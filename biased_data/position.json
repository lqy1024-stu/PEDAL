        "instruction": "ON the surface it would seem that children's books have never had it so bad. Many carry adult-size price tags. Libraries, long the major purchasers of children's books, are suffering from significant cutbacks in governmental funding. The popularity of video games has led Stephen Roxburg, editor of children's books at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, to lament, only half-facetiously, that America may become a nation of illiterate space pilots.\n\nYet, with it all, sales of children's books continue to rise steadily. Some 40,000 are in print and 2,500 to 3,000 titles are added each year.\n\n''The marketplace is much more media-dominated than it was years ago,'' said Gerald Harrison, vice president of juvenile publishing at Random House. ''Books based on movie properties, like 'Star Wars' or 'Black Stallion,' or tied in to television are probably the fastestselling books in the country.''\n\nSales of juvenile paperbacks have soared from virtually nothing six years ago to about a third of the annual sales of $270 million. That may not sound like much alongside the book industry's annual sales of $7 billion, but it is hardly kid stuff for the 50 or so publishers of children's books.\n\n''They are an extremely important part of our publishing program, accounting for between 35 and 40 percent of our net sales and revenues,'' said Lawrence Hughes, president of William Morrow.\n\nWith all the changes, the industry's backbone continues to be traditional hardcover books, many of which, long in print and still selling briskly, have depicted characters that endure.\n\n''Pinocchio'' was published a hundred years ago and Lewis Carroll's Alice books were also born in the 19th century. Peter Rabbit is a youthful 81. And Babar, Winnie the Pooh, the Black Stallion, the Hardy Boys, Pippi Longstocking, the Bobbsey Twins, Nancy Drew, the Little Prince and Doctor Doolittle are all old enough to be worrying about the solvency of the Social Security system.\n\nUnlike adult books, which may be quickly remaindered at a fraction of their cost, slower-selling children's books often stay in print. As for the big sellers, they never disappear. None of the more than 40 Dr. Seuss books written by Theodor Geisel since 1937 have been out of print.\n\nWriters and illustrators increasingly consider children's books an art form. ''Many of the young people admire children's book writers and illustrators as role models,'' said Mr. Roxburgh of Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Linda Zuckerman, editorial director of Viking Press junior books, said, ''A good children's book provides perhaps the only place aside from a museum where a child can see good art.''\n\nAccording to Barbara Harrison, director of the Center for the Study of Children's Literature at Simmons College, Boston, the newer books ''exhibit a heightened awareness of the role of women in society and a heightened respect for ethnicity and minorities in our society.''\n\nIn contrast to the hurly-burly world of adult books, the publishing of children's books still has a genteel aspect. The main reason is that the stakes are not as high because subsidiary rights (sales for paperbacks and to movies or television) are not yet a principal source of income.\n\nEven that is changing. Many more books are submitted through literary agents, advertising budgets are higher and far more children's authors are going on promotional tours. Most important, those familiar children's characters lead to remunerative merchandising tie-ins - everything from stuffed animals to stationery and from puzzles to pajamas.\n\nThe relatively small Frederick Warne publishing company (the century-old New York subsidiary of the London house that controls the estate of Beatrix Potter, creator of Peter Rabbit) earned $7 million last year from the sale of Potter books in America and from merchandise based on the characters. Miss Piggy has demonstrated with calendars, posters and her best-selling ''Miss Piggy's Guide to Life'' how to turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.\n\nEditors say they look for the same qualities in children's books that make adult books successful: an original story well told. If they find it they often match writer with illustrator, although many illustrators, including Richard Scarry, Maurice Sendak and Shel Silverstein, write their texts.\n\nSuccessful children's books have been written by many ''serious'' writers, including Mark Twain, Isaac Bashevis Singer, E.B. White, James Thurber, John Updike, Madeleine L'Engle, Donald Barthelme, Randall Jarrell, Alison Lurie and Roald Dahl.\n\n''But it's not as easy to go from one to the other as you might think,'' said Miss Zuckerman of Viking. ''It's a little like assuming it's easier to write poetry than a novel, and it's not. There is so little text in a children's book that every single word is very important and any weakness in the narrative is very obvious.''",

        "instruction": "The Russian-made Ural Sahara looks like a beautifully preserved sidecar motorcycle, a barn find pulled from some remote Siberian grain silo.\n\nBut it’s actually brand new, and it’s made this way on purpose. Rude, rugged and retro, it may be the fastest way on wheels to get attention and make new friends.\n\nThe Ural motorcycle company got its start copying BMW R71 motorcycles for military use in the 1940s, after Josef Stalin decided he wanted battlefield bikes just like the Germans had.\n\nHis minions reportedly bought four, through a secret Swedish intermediary, and had them shipped to Moscow. They were dismantled and reverse engineered, and a year later, the first copies were seeing duty on the Western Front.\n\nMore than 75 years later, Ural is still building the basic machine the same way.\n\nAll the motorcycles in the Ural line are powered by an air-cooled, 750 cubic centimeters “boxer” twin four-stroke engine that makes 41 horsepower and 42 pound feet of torque, through a six-speed transmission and shaft drive.\n\nThey look like vintage bikes, sound like vintage bikes and ride the same way. They’re clunky, clumsy, stodgy and slow — and so much fun!\n\nSince I rode and reviewed my first Ural Gear Up, a few years back, the company (whose machines are imported by an outfit in Redmond, Wash.) has made useful updates. The Urals now feature Brembo disc brakes on the front and sidecar wheels and fuel injection.\n\nThe Urals are burly, weighing in at 730 pounds, with no fuel in the gas tank and without a passenger in the rumble seat. And, like all sidecars, they require a certain amount of muscle, and patience, to operate.\n\nRiding one in a straight line, on a flat road, is easy work. (Although stopping one, without available ABS, is a little challenging.) Riding one on any other surface, or with any kind of twists or turns, is a more athletic affair.\n\nOn one sharp right-hand turn, I felt the sidecar’s side wheel leave the pavement and float a bit. This is what sidecar stallions call “flying the wheel.” It doesn’t happen when the sidecar is carrying a load. That’s why some sidehacks keep a cinder block or sack of sand in the sidecar when they’re riding solo.\n\nThe suspension, from retro leading link front end to the old-fashioned-feeling twin Sachs hydraulic shocks, is stiff. It’s ready to support a fully loaded luggage rack or a sidecar full of best friend, but when unladen, it’s pretty hard on the potholes. The rear is adjustable, but the front is not.\n\nThe Urals feature modern electric starters but also have a good, old-fashioned kick-starter. Just for fun, and to make fun of how hard these beasts are to operate, I tried kick-starting the bike to life, wearing sneakers. Impressively, the Sahara started right up.\n\nBecause of its weight and three-wheeled construction, the Ural features a hand-activated parking brake and a reverse gear, activated by a right-side pedal.\n\nThere’s also a hand lever that will engage the Ural’s unusual two-wheel drive. This connects straight-cut gears in the wheel hub through a drive shaft to the outside sidecar wheel.\n\nThus weaponized, the Ural can climb out of deep sand, soft snow or whatever tar pit it’s fallen into. But it can’t be steered in this high-traction formulation. It’ll pull you out of the muck, but only in a more or less straight line.\n\nUral makes several machines for export into the U.S. The sand-colored Gear Up Sahara version, new this year, is ready for desert duty.\n\nIt comes standard with a locking storage compartment big enough for two full-face helmets, spare tire, tire pump, a small locking compartment built into the top of the gas tank, a full tool kit, canvas sidecar cover, sidecar-mounted spotlight, plug-ins for accessories, a metal jerry can and a utility shovel.\n\n(The jerry can has a label on it reading, “Not for gasoline and drinking water.” So, that’s where you keep the Stoli.)\n\nSaid to get about 35 miles to the gallon, the Ural has a range of up to 180 miles to its five-gallon tank. And 180 miles would be quite a lot of riding on this beast, which will go long and hard, but not fast. Although it has an advertised maximum cruising freeway speed of 70 mph, this rider didn’t feel confident going more than 60.\n\nThe Sahara also can be had with a very robust “Off Road Package,” which includes fog lights, aftermarket windscreen, extra luggage racks, engine and body guards, and an Enduro-style bench seat.\n\nIt adds up to an extremely handsome, eye-grabbing package that, around town, gets a remarkable amount of attention. Like, a lot.\n\nHaving driven the Los Angeles streets in any number of extremely exotic and expensive two- and four-wheeled vehicles, I can say I never got noticed more than the two times I rode around on Urals.\n\nThe entry-level Sahara retails for $17,999, before tax, license and handling. The “Off Road Package” adds $1,999, and an upgraded exhaust goes for an additional $1,499. Heidenau K37 knobby tires are also available, at $550 a set.\n\nThat adds up to a chunky hunk of change. And while three-wheeled Harley-Davidsons, after-market sidecar Honda Gold Wings or triangulated Can-Am Spyders are equally expensive, they’re all mechanically superior to the Ural — more comfortable to ride, easier to get parts for, better made and likelier to last longer.\n\nBut if you want to make friends fast and feel like a celebrity at every stoplight, the Ural is for you.\n\nOur top picks from the L.A. Auto Show\n\nSubaru's VIZIV-7 is big, and its sales are too\n\nAmong subcompact crossovers, Toyota's CH-R is a cheaper, edgier-looking option",

Go figure.\n\nWhat if you took all the estimates by all the analysts who write about Apple AAPL — and there are dozens — and ranked them by how closely their predictions matched the company’s quarterly earnings reports. Would you be interested in who came in first?\n\nDaniel Tello, a Venezuelan amateur with a strong track record of his own, has done that for the past three quarters (see list here and below the fold). The man you see at right rose to the top.\n\nHis name is Horace Dediu, and Wall Street could learn a thing or two from him.\n\nHe’s a 42-year-old Romanian engineer who started following Steve Jobs and company two years ago while doing market analysis for Nokia NOK . His day job was to track Research in Motion RIMM , not Apple. “Apple wasn’t considered an interesting or valid threat, even in 2008,” he recalls.\n\nBut from reading the analysts reports he was getting at Nokia, he could tell that none of them understood the subscription accounting method Apple was using at the time to record iPhone sales. “I knew they were wrong,” he says. So he built his own spreadsheet.\n\n“My model is very simple,” he says. “I look at growth rate.”\n\n“My basic investment thesis was that the iPhone was going to be much much bigger than anyone knew. The market is so huge — 1.2 billion phones a year — and Apple’s penetration is only 2%. So there isn’t any problem with demand. It’s all about production issues and how to deliver supply to this market.”\n\nDediu started with the assumption that iPhone sales would grow 100% a year if Apple could build the devices fast enough — a big if.\n\n“The reason Apple is so constrained,” he says, “is that they are so motivated to improve product. They are always ramping up and ramping down. Always launching in summer, trying to reach peak for Christmas. The question is, how steeply can they ramp up? Each time is different.\n\n“The next question is, will the iPad follow the same cycle? Will it launch every year in the spring? Will they keep the older generation around at a lower price point? These are questions we don’t have answers for yet. But I think the iPad can also ramp up at 100% each year.”\n\nDediu started sharing his estimates with other amateurs at The Mac Observer’s Apple Finance Board. “Andy Zaky, Turley Muller and Daniel Tello — they were like superstars for me,” he says.\n\nIn July 2009, he started posting Apple commentary on his Asymco blog. The site has grown quickly — last month it drew 388,000 page views — but earns nowhere near enough to support his wife and five-year-old young son. Meanwhile, he’s developing some apps and working a few consulting gigs that came to him from readers.\n\nThe community of Apple blogger-analysts is a small one, and Dediu — a relative newcomer — has earned the grudging respect of his peers.\n\n“He’s good, but not infallible,” says Tello, who posts his estimates on Deagol’s AAPL Model. “His best skill is that he can put these complex market dynamics in plain English, and with a nice touch of humor/sarcasm to boot.” (And, we might add, with smart graphics that have been featured many times in this space. See, for just a few examples, here, here and here.)\n\nFinancial Alchemist’s Turley Muller, who has the best long-term track record of the bunch (he was No. 1 in our quarterly Earnings Smackdown for seven quarters in a row and had the best revenue estimate again last quarter) is withholding judgment until he sees more than two quarters of data from Dediu. “Horace is good and he’s been lucky,” says Muller. “He certainly has the talent to improve his odds when his isn’t.”\n\nDediu holds some shares of Apple stock — and some Google GOOG — that he bought before he began blogging, but he doesn’t trade. And he advises anybody who asks not to play the market either.\n\n“What learned in business school is that all the trading strategies are bull,” he says. “Every quarter I find amazing disconnects with the fundamentals.”\n\n[Follow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter @philiped]",

However, cable analysts speculated that the price, which works out to $72 a share, might be inadequate to satisfy UA-Columbia's shareholders.\n\nThe development further underscores the growing appetite of major corporations to acquire independent cable companies. It represents a logical move for both Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, and Knight-Ridder, one of the country's biggest newspaper chains. Both companies have been experimenting in video technologies. This marks the first time, however, that two companies have joined forces to try to buy a cable property. The only similar arrangement was when Warner Communications sold half of its cable subsidiary to American Express.\n\n''From our point of view, it's a big transaction,'' a Dow Jones spokesman said, ''and when two substantial companies go after something jointly they can get something of greater quality.'' Earlier Proposal Cited\n\nDow Jones's role in the proposal came about after a joint effort between Knight-Ridder and Newhouse Publications collapsed last year, a UA-Columbia spokesman said. No formal offer was made because the tentative plan involved breaking up UA-Columbia, which would have been unacceptable to the cable company.\n\nRobert Rosencrans, UA-Columbia's president, said, ''I had not anticipated the offer, though I knew both companies were interested in us for some months.'' He declined to predict whether the proposal would be accepted, but said it would be presented to the company's board on March 4.\n\nLast year, the cable company, one of the fastest-growing and bestrespected in the industry, retained the investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley Inc. to furnish it with counsel, because several large shareholders had expressed interest in selling their shares. Since then, it has had informal talks with a variety of potential suitors.\n\n''It's my own personal opinion that a price of $72 a share is not particularly thrilling,'' said John Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham. ''I don't see the deal going through at this price.''\n\nBy working in UA-Columbia's $100 million of debt and the value of a joint cable programming system delivered by satellite that the company owns with Madison Square Garden, Mr. Reidy calculated that the offer works out to about $770 per subscriber. That is within the ballpark of recent cable purchases, though some acquisitions have exceeded $800 a subscriber. Stock Gains 5 3/4\n\nAmong possible hurdles that the proposal faces is the fact that United Artists Theatre Circuit, which is unrelated to United Artists, owns 28 percent of UA-Columbia's stock, and it has indicated recently that it is not keen to sell.\n\nAlso, although UA-Columbia's stock has been trading recently on the over-the-counter market at about $55, it hit a peak of $80 only last year. Yesterday it rose 5 3/4, to 61 1/2 bid. According to Paul Kagan, a cable appraiser and analyst, ''Wall Street people last year were talking about $70 to $90 a share as a possibility for UAColumbia.''\n\n''It's not a bargain-counter offer, nor is it super-duper,'' another cable analyst commented. ''I think Dow Jones and KnightRidder will have to push their pencils to see what they're really willing to pay.'' 7/8\n\nOn the New York Stock Exchange, Dow Jones closed yesterday at 60 7/8, off 3/8, and Knight-Ridder closed at 28 1/4, off 1/8. UA-Columbia currently has about 420,000 subscribers, and has been gaining new ones at the rate of 5,000 to 8,000 a month. It has particularly lucrative franchises in northern New Jersey, Westchester and San Antonio, and a strong chance to snare the award in Fairfield County, Conn. Company Set Up in 1962\n\nCurrently based in Westport, Conn., the company was formed in 1962 as Columbia Cable Systems. Its name was changed in December 1972 when it was merged with UA Cablevision, an entity spun off from United Artists Theatre Circuit.\n\nLast year, UA-Columbia earned $4.8 million on revenues of $54.9 million. Under the proposal from Dow Jones and Knight-Ridder, UA-Columbia would become part of a new company created by the two publishers, and it would remain a separate company. All of the current management would be invited to continue in their posts.\n\nKnight-Ridder's 33 papers, including The Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Detroit Free Press, have a combined daily circulation of 3.6 million, second only to the Gannett chain. It also owns television stations, a commodity wire service and a book publisher.\n\nLast summer, its Viewdata subsidiary started an experiment in Coral Gables, Fla, with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to test a Viewtron electronic home information service. The company had earnings last year of $92.9 million on revenues of $1.09 billion.\n\nDow Jones also owns Barron's, the Dow Jones News Service, the Ottaway Newspaper chain, Book Digest, broadcast news service, and a college textbook publisher. The company owns 40 percent of a recently formed subsidiary called Home Link Communications, based in Princeton, N.J. Only this week, it was awarded franchises to wire 86,000 Princeton homes with a 110-channel cable system.\n\nDow Jones is developing an electronic newspaper designed for cable pickup, and is expanding its financial data bases by using them in electronic retrieval services. The company earned $58.8 million last year on revenues of $530.7 million.\n\n''Obviously this offer ties in with the interests of newspaper companies preparing for the time when cable competes with newspapers, not only in an editorial sense but in things like classified advertising,'' said Jonh Morton, a newspaper analyst at John Muir & Company.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 18— The storming of the United States Embassy in Teheran in November 1979 was the first of three incidents that changed State Department thinking on how to protect American lives and property abroad.\n\nUntil mobs took the embassy in Iran and then other crowds, within weeks of the Teheran attack, sacked and burned the embassies in Islamabad, Pakistan, and Tripoli, Libya, United States security measures had been designed to deter or repel terrorists acting alone or in small groups, State Department officials said.\n\nEmbassy employees were taught how to kick away a single grenade.Envoys were told to meet with groups of protesters accompanied by as many security officers as there were visitors. Diplomatic families were taught some tricks to reduce the risk of kidnapping.\n\nThe killing of an American military attache near his home in Paris this morning by a solitary gunman shows the continuing difficulty of protecting diplomats against attacks outside an embassy compound.\n\nAfter the events of November and Decem ber 1979, officials say, the United States had to face a new phenomenon: angry, rampaging, destructive h ordes of people that local governments, contrary to normal intern ational practice, would not or could not control. 'Security Enhancement Program'\n\nThe reassessment has led to a $41 million ''security enhancement program'' for embassies and consulates abroad. It has also led to a questioning of how high a price should be paid for diplomatic representation, according to diplomats working on security matters, who asked not to be identified.\n\nIf a host government should prove unable or unwilling to guarantee security, the United States is now prepared to consider reducing or ending its diplomatic presence, according to officials. Thus, while the United States maintains diplomatic relations with the Libyan Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, it has no diplomatic presence in Tripoli and provides no normal consular services there.\n\nIn Chad, where the Government of President Goukouni Oueddei, fighting a civil war, was thought to be unable to provide a safe environment for the conduct of diplomacy, the American presence was also reduced to a bare minimum. Conditions at other seriously threatened posts abroad are ''under review,'' officials say.\n\nTwenty-four active embassies and consulates - the State Department will not name them for security reasons -have been identified as ''high risk'' posts. Priority has been given to improving and fortifying them. Objective Is to 'Buy Time'\n\nWhen an embassy is identified as a high risk, alterations are made to the building or compound that might ''buy time'' in the event of a sizable attack, officials say. This can mean providing extra space - between outer and inner walls, for example - where larger security forces can attempt to fight off attackers while embassy personnel seek secure quarters.\n\nInside those embassies, ''safe havens'' are being created; defensible spaces that are fireproofed and fortified to withstand small-arms fire. Ventilating equipment is improved to accommodate people in crowded conditions when there is no access to fresh air.\n\nThe loss of classified material from an embassy under attack has also been a concern of the State Department. Joseph Subic, one of the hostages held in Teheran, who had worked as a document custodian, said last month that the United States had lost thousands of pages of defense attache reports and Defense Intelligence Agency plans in the takeover of the embassy. He charged that there had been too much material around the embassy to be destroyed in a short time, and that shredding machines had left some documents in pieces large enough to be reassembled by the Iranian militants. The State Department has refused to comment on Mr. Subic's statements. Embassies Given a 'Burn Time'\n\nUnder new security procedures, however, each embassy is assigned a ''burn time'' that varies according to the estimated risk of attack in that city. Embassies are told to keep on hand only as much sensitive material as can be destroyed within that assigned time. According to security experts, the ''burn time'' of some embassies is as short as 30 minutes. Mr. Subic had estimated that it would have taken 24 hours to destroy the material in Teheran in 1979.\n\nEmbassies are also reportedly getting more effectiv e shredding and incinerating machines. A check of several capitals by corresponden ts of The New York Timeshas shown increased security in many of them. At the United States Embassy in New Delhi, for example, the fence enclosing the compound has been replaced by o ne with sharpened spikesand curved barbs at the top to discourage cli mbers. Identification isnow demanded of visitors at gatehouses about 400 feet from the embassy proper. Housing Facilities Consolidated\n\nAmerican diplomats in India, where demonstrations by large crowds are a usual part of the local politics, are gradually being moved out of houses scattered around town into new housing where families are clustered.\n\nThe policy of grouping diplomatic families is a subject of disagreement among security officials in American as well as other Western embassies abroad. Some diplomats feel that the concentration of personnel invites attention more than it guarantees security.",

The average, while 91 cents below a year earlier, may start to creep up after 17 straight weeks of declines, said Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey.\n\n“We have somewhat higher crude oil prices, and they pushed US refiners to nudge their wholesale gasoline selling prices up, which in turn put a stop to retailers’ price-cutting at the pump,” Lundberg said Sunday. “I think the price-cutting is over for now, and we might actually see a slight rise in the national average.”\n\nThe highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 states among the markets surveyed was in Los Angeles, at $2.96 a gallon.

As they did with \"Guffman\" (which lampooned regional theater) and \"Show\" (dog competitions), director Guest and Levy created a setting, characters and story outline, and then let their ensemble cast improvise.\n\nLevy plays the psychologically impaired Mitch of the once-beloved Mitch and Mickey (Catherine O'Hara). Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean play the Folksmen, a Kingston Trio-style outfit. Guest points out in his DVD commentary with Levy that the threesome's back-story includes serving as opening act for Spinal Tap, the equally nonexistent heavy metal band portrayed by the same three actors.\n\nThe DVD, which is released on Tuesday, includes \"biographies\" of all the groups; Â­deleted scenes; a press conference in which the folkies address rap (Mitch likes it); a Â­fuller version of the climactic concert done like a PBS special, and old TV appearances by the various groups, including the Folksmen \"going electric\" on a late-'60s variety show.\n\n\"Guffman\" and \"Show\" remain available individually from Warner, but they also come in a new three-pack with \"Wind.\" Rob Â­Reiner's \"This Is Spinal Tap\" (1984) is available from MGM.\n\nIf you really, really love Lucy, you can now get the entire first Â­season of \"I Love Lucy\" in a box set from Paramount. The 1951-52 run of 36 episodes takes up nine disks (about $135 for the set, $14.99 individually). All the elements were in place from the start: Lucille Ball and bandÂ­leader husband Desi Arnaz, of course, plus the landlords/best friends Vivian Vance and William Frawley (whose May-December marriage, alas, goes unexplained). Extras include the \"lost pilot,\" the original opening sequence, guest cast info and on-the-set photos.\n\nCall it \"Cool Hand LaBeouf.\" In \"Holes\" (Disney, 117 mins., rated PG, $29.99), Shia LaBeouf of Disney Channel's \"Even Stevens\" plays a city kid unjustly convicted of stealing sneakers and sentenced to a reform camp in the Texas desert. He and fellow inmates must dig 5-foot pits every day on the orders of the sadistic warden (Sigourney Weaver) and her snarling enforcer (Jon Voight). While the boys think it's a character-building exercise, there's a more cynical reason behind the punishment.\n\nDirector Andrew Davis (\"The Fugitive\"), Weaver and LaBeouf are interviewed on the disk and express admiration for Louis Â­Sachar's novel, a best seller among young readers. Davis says he wanted to involve Sachar in the movie more deeply than most screenwriters - Sachar has a small role in the film and shares a commentary with Davis. A second commentary track with the boy actors is, not surprisingly, a jokier, more casual affair.",

And yet they were also human beings, energetic, agreeable. Their obstinacy in sticking to their customs, one could not deny it respect. Moreover, their girls were pretty.''\n\nQuickly -- although not nearly as thoroughly as Amos Elon suggests in ''The Pity of It All'' -- the Jews of Germany made themselves over, inspired by the prospect of joining a world that transcended religious barriers, a world glimpsed by the more mature Goethe, and Schiller, and Lessing and, somewhat later, Thomas Mann. These were Jews who read fiction and poetry as fact or, at least, as prophecy. As Elon sees it, their story in modernity starts with the buoyant optimism of the Jewish Enlightenment sage Moses Mendelssohn and ends soon after the desiccated, nightmarish premonitions of Franz Kafka.\n\nElon, a provocative, well-known Israeli journalist, has written a curiously old-fashioned, even elegiac portrait. The story he tells is a fairly familiar one of a community (never more than about 1 percent of the total German population) that experienced modernity, as the cultural historian Fritz Stern has put it, in ''one of the most spectacular leaps in European history.'' Much like Elon's previous books, which include a superb history of Israel and a biography of Theodor Herzl, it is a work packed with beautifully sketched portraits, and constructed with a practiced eye for memorable, well-executed anecdotes. But despite its stated intent not to see the history of German Jews as leading relentlessly to World War II and the Holocaust, and despite its desire to take their experience in modernity seriously, Elon never quite manages to remove himself from the poignancy, the tragedy of the tale's final, horrible end.\n\nThis is a self-consciously synthetic volume and owes much, as Elon acknowledges, to the scholars Peter Gay, George Mosse and Gordon Craig and, in particular, to Fritz Stern. Stern's insightful explorations of the interplay between German and Jewish allegiances inspire the book throughout, but what is in Stern a subtle, complex and also deeply ambiguous account turns all too transparent and hollow in Elon's hands. It is not so much that Elon's narrative is wrong, but that it doesn't quite allow its subjects -- mostly, as it happens, males, intellectuals, freethinkers and rebels -- to breathe, to persuade us that their life choices, and in particular their various, often conflicted feelings about German culture, make sense.\n\n''The Pity of It All'' begins with the precocious young Moses Mendelssohn, soon to be the father of the Jewish Enlightenment, at the gates of mid-18th-century Berlin. Elon moves on to a predictable pantheon of Central European Jewish-born luminaries that includes the philosopher Salomon Maimon, Heine, the political leader Gabriel Riesser and, eventually, Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig and Hannah Arendt. The book ends with Arendt fleeing the now hate-ridden city that had once celebrated Mendelssohn. ''She, too, had her history, her loves and her friends, and they had failed her. A circle was closing.''\n\nIt is, to be sure, an excruciatingly difficult, confounding story. From an early-19th-century community still much akin socially and culturally to their brethren in Eastern Europe, Jews in Germany emerged by midcentury as overwhelmingly middle class, and more so: by the early 20th century, their prominence in the arts, in literature, in psychoanalysis, in music and perhaps especially in the physical sciences meant that friends and foes alike took for granted some special Jewish penchant for intellect, a sort of lock on genius. It was as if, as Einstein observed, the Jews of Germany had spent the last two thousand years preparing for their university entrance examinations.\n\nThis all occurred in what was, or at least seemed by the late 19th century to be, Europe's most cultivated, certainly its best-educated country. Germany had the world's finest elementary school system, the highest literacy rate and the best universities; by 1913 more books were published annually in Germany than in any country in the world. Its technical skill, its industry, its relentless business savvy (a trait, interestingly, commonly associated at the time with both Germans and Jews) marked it off as among modernity's singular successes. The Weimar era, the German Jewish sociologist Karl Mannheim boasted, represented a new Periclean age. Soon he, like so many others fortunate enough to survive, had to flee for his life.\n\nIt is little surprise that the rapidity with which liberal Weimar was transmuted into the Third Reich continues to astonish, and may well astonish always. It is unrealistic -- and also, no doubt, useless -- to insist that historians write about the pre-Nazi past as if they didn't know what was coming in the 1930's and 40's. Moreover, among the pertinent questions historians must ask about modern German history, and that can only be asked in retrospect, is this: What was it that existed, however unevenly beneath the surface, that fed into the murderous rage, the hunger for revenge and devastation that was Nazism?",

Reptiles who rule the world.\n\nWhat, in the name of our alleged lizard overlords, convinces a person to believe in conspiracy theories?\n\nAccording to a pair of new studies published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology, conspiracy theorists—and there are a lot more of them than you may think—tend to have one thing in common: they feel a lack of control over their lives.\n\nJan-Willem van Prooijen, associate professor in social and organizational psychology at VU University Amsterdam, has been studying conspiracy theories and those who believe them for six years. “When I started this research, one of the things that I really found astonishing was how many people believe in certain conspiracy theories,” he says.\n\nMORE: Extraterrestrials on a Comet Are Faking Climate Change. Or Something\n\nConspiracy theories often crop up during times of uncertainty and fear: after terrorist strikes, financial crises, high-profile deaths and natural disasters. Past research suggests that if people feel they don’t have control over a situation, they’ll try to make sense of it and find out what happened. “The sense-making leads them to connect dots that aren’t necessarily connected in reality,” van Prooijen says.\n\nHe and his team showed that the opposite is also true: feeling a sense of control is protective against believing conspiracy theories. In one of the studies, they split 119 people into two groups and told one group to write down times when they were totally in control; the other group was told to jot down a time when they didn’t feel in control. (This gave one group a powerful feeling, while the other felt helpless.)\n\nThe researchers then surveyed their attitudes on a building project in Amsterdam that accidentally destroyed the foundations of many houses, and which many people believed was a conspiracy of the city council. But those who had been primed to feel in control were less likely to believe the government was up to something evil. “We found that if you give people a feeling of control, then they are less inclined to believe those conspiracy theories,” he says. “Giving people a sense of control can make them less suspicious over governmental operations.”\n\nMORE: What The Jade Helm 15 Conspiracy Theory Reveals About Americans\n\nThe Dutch, of course, aren’t the only believers. The second experiment looked at survey data from a nationally representative sample of Americans conducted in the last months of 1999 leading up to Y2K. “The more that people feared the millennium bug in 1999, the more likely they were inclined to believe in other conspiracy theories, ranging from Kennedy to the government hiding evidence of the existence of UFOs,” van Prooijen says. The best predictor of believing in one conspiracy, he says, is believing in another.\n\nThis finding backs up data from another group last year, which found that 37% of surveyed Americans believe that the FDA is deliberately preventing the public from accessing natural cures for cancer because they’re beholden to drug companies.\n\nThese beliefs can be very hard to change, but giving people a feeling of control could help dispel some conspiratorial beliefs, the new research suggests—a finding that could prove useful worldwide. “There are no doubt cultural variables influencing it,” van Prooijen says. “But the essence of conspiracy theorizing is, I think, universal in human beings. People have a natural tendency to be suspicious of groups that are powerful and potentially hostile.”",

She has been anything but a failure as a writer, however, having written a number of children's books under the name Molly Kaye, as well as nine mysteries and three big-selling historical romances under the name M.M. Kaye. Her most recent book is ''Trade Wind'' (St. Martin's Press), currently No. 9 on the fiction best-seller list, and the successor to her previous big sellers, ''The Far Pavilions'' and ''Shadow of the Moon.''\n\nIn fact, ''Trade Wind'' was written years before ''The Far Pavilions'' and was first published in this country by Coward, McCann in 1964, but it did not sell very well. ''I can't think why it sold at all,'' the author declared in a telephone conversation from her home in Sussex, some 50 miles from London. ''The American edition was the same as the British, and my British publisher cut out my entire first chapter - the chapter all about the heroine and what makes her tick.''\n\nThe heroine is Hero Athena Hollis, a wealthy New England orphan who in the mid-19th century sets out for Zanzibar, where her uncle is American consul, and soon falls into the clutches of Rory Frost, an English sea captain and slave trader. ''My British editor was mad about Conrad, and he was interested in the part about slavery, so he started the book with the chasing of slaves. He compressed Hero's background into about three-quarters of a page.''\n\nThe new version of ''Trade Wind'' consists of the original opening chapter as well as several other chapters that were excised in the earlier version.\n\nSimilarly, ''Shadow of the Moon,'' Miss Kaye's novel about the Sepoy rebellion in India, was originally published in the United States in 1957 and published in its fuller version two years ago. ''My publishers cut the earlier version down savagely,'' she said.''They and my American agent at that time said nobody in America is interested in India. That's why my next book was about Zanzibar.''\n\nFew writers whose books bombed in earlier versions have ever been given the opportunity to see them published in the original. What turned the trick for Miss Kaye was the vast popularity of ''The Far Pavilions,'' her 1978 best-seller about the India of the Raj in the 19th century, a book that took almost 15 years to write. ''If that hadn't been a success I don't think anybody would have taken a chance on republishing the other two,'' she said.\n\nAt age 70, a grandmother with two daughters, Miss Kaye acknowledges that fame came somewhat late. ''I probably would have had a lot more fun if it had come earlier,'' she said. ''I would have bought a mink coat, a fast car and other silly things. But when you're older, you don't want so much - you have your house, your husband and your children, and you're content. Besides, when you're older you can read all about your success and you know enough not to believe a word of it.''\n\nMiss Kaye has no plans for other revisions, nor any other novels. ''I'm going to try to write my autobiography,'' she said. ''There must have been thousands of people who lived the kind of life I did, but I think I'm able to put it on paper and I think enough people might want to read what I have to say.''\n\nBorn in India of a British father and a mother who was born in China of missionary parents, Miss Kaye was educated in England and lived two years in China during the 1930's. She married Goff Hamilton, now a retired major general, and afterwards lived in a good many other British outposts around the world. ''In fact, I went to Zanzibar when my husband's British regiment was sent to Kenya in the 1950's,'' she said. ''I'm an army wife before I'm an author.''",

But rather than clinging to a mountainside near a ski resort, this one-room A-frame is perched atop the Dakota, one of New York's most celebrated apartment houses, and its views are not pristine wildernesses and moonlit landscapes but the woods and meadows of Central Park and the skyline of Manhattan.\n\nThe sheer, clean lines of this modern structure strike a bold contrast to the filigreed Dakota, whose 19th-century exterior was described by one architectural critic as ''an elaborate, eclectic composition, sort of a mix of Germanic, chateauesque and English Victorian details.'' But the stark A-frame is not esthetically offensive or jarring, for it is incorporated into a soaring, two-story gable of the same shape. Originally used for storage, the gable is flanked by the water tanks used to run the building's hydraulic elevators.\n\nMr. Bennett, a designer acclaimed for his spare, clean-lined, yet meticulously detailed interiors, also lives in the Dakota. It was his own apartment, a remodeled tower adjacent to the gable, that inspired his neighbors, a couple who are both professionals in the art world and who own an apartment on the Dakota's top floor directly below the gable, to think of expanding upward when they decided they needed a retreat where they could consolidate their ever-expanding collections of art, artifacts and books.\n\nThey asked Mr. Bennett if he would design for them a room in the manner of his own apartment - providing that they were allowed to purchase the gable in the cooperative building. He agreed, the gable was duly purchased, and an aperture was created to allow access from the lower floor. Today a spiral staircase connects the modern 13-foot-by-15-foot room to the more traditionally decorated apartment below.\n\nLinking the apartment with its new addition was the easiest structural challenge that Mr. Bennett faced. In order to take full advantage of the view, the sloping south wall of the steel-framed, masonry gable was replaced with an anodized, aluminum-framed glass wall. And because the structure is on the windswept and sun-baked roof, it had to be outfitted with auxiliary heating and airconditioning, with the mechanical equipment carefully concealed.\n\nOnce these obstacles were overcome and the structure completed, Mr. Bennett permanently divided the small room into two spaces and furnished them primarily with leather-and-steel furniture of his own design. The conversation area is next to the glass wall. On the other side of the room, where a book-lined wall dominates, there is a large marble-topped table supported by a fixed stainless-steel column. The kid leather, steel-framed chairs surrounding it are lower than the usual dining height, and the table is correspondingly 26 1/2 inches high, a height that Mr. Bennett finds ideal for dining or relaxing.\n\nThe lighting for the white room is provided by movable, matte-black quartz fixtures affixed to structural elements. The lights are on a rheostat, or dimmer, and can be turned up for reading or down for relaxing in the evening light. Says Mr. Bennett: ''The main objective for the night lighting was to get the interior light to match the outside city light. The lights of Central Park are also quartz and they reflect on the white walls. The idea was to balance the two light sources in order to produce a candlelit effect.''\n\nThe space is completed with the display of the owners' extensive collection of museum-quality Indian art and artifacts. For those who appreciate irony, the venerable Dakota's A-frame seems just the right place to house such a collection, for the Dakota's unlikely moniker springs from from the fact that, when the building was erected in 1884, its location was so far uptown on Manhattan's West Side that it might as well have been in the Indian territories.",

The teen-ager has said their relationship became intimate only after the two began their odyssey across the country.\n\n\"Sex between teachers and students is much more common than people are willing to acknowledge,\" said Charol Shakeshaft, a Hofstra University professor and co-author of a four-year study on school sexual abuse that appeared this March in Phi Delta Kappan, an education journal.\n\nDespite its frequency, teacher-student sex is always wrong, educators said, a betrayal of trust that is harmful to the student and indicative of an emotional defect in the teacher.\n\nA vast majority of teachers never molest their students and would never take advantage of a child's crush, researchers and school officials said. But Ms. Shakeshaft's study quoted findings that up to 5 percent of teachers engage in some form of sexual abuse of students, from inappropriate verbal flirtation to intercourse. A nationwide survey in 1993 by the American Association of University Women found that nearly 15 percent of 8th to 11th graders, 25 percent of girls and 10 percent of boys, had been sexually harassed by a staff member.\n\nThe most striking statistics come from a 1991 survey of students at a North Carolina high school, published in The Journal of Education Research, in which 13 percent of graduates said they had had sex with a teacher.\n\nThat 13 percent may be exaggerated, Ms. Shakeshaft said, but she said that students tended to be more accurate reporters of sexual contact than are teachers or principals, who often try to cover up the incidents.\n\nIn New York City, 110 cases of school sexual abuse have been reported since 1991, most of them concerning some kind of willing involvement by a smitten student.\n\nCases like Christina's and the Richmond Hill student's fall into the category of what Ms. Shakeshaft's study called \"bad judgment romance,\" in which young male teachers become intimate with attractive older female students. Cases involving female teachers and male students, and homosexual liaisons, are much rarer.\n\n\"These abusers saw their actions as either harmless or romantic,\" the report said. Ms. Shakeshaft estimated that \"bad judgment\" abusers outnumbered pedophiles -- who seek work in schools to molest children -- 2 to 1. She found that female victims in high schools most often looked mature for their age and had \"bad girl\" reputations.\n\nAs for the teachers, their inability to resist the temptations of young students indicates something deeply wrong emotionally, psychologists said.\n\nNormally, said Bonnie Jacobson, a clinical psychologist and author of books on relationships, young children have a sense of being perfect and all powerful, but grow out of it at age 4. But teachers, therapists and others in a position of power who have never resolved that phase can start taking to heart the admiration they get from students and subordinates, and abuse it.\n\n\"They really use the person who's giving that level of adoration,\" she said. \"It's not always conscious, but it's very destructive, very destructive.\"\n\nAfter Ms. Shakeshaft's study came out, more than a dozen women wrote her to describe the pain they still felt over affairs, some of them years old.\n\n\"The pain is lifelong,\" she said. \"They never are able to overcome the sense of betrayal over what happened. And they wrote us about how they had trouble trusting, trouble believing, and trouble carrying on intimate relations as adults.\"\n\nIn recent years, public discussion of sexual harassment in schools and universities has made teachers more aware than ever that they should not take advantage of students.\n\nBut at the same time, said Alvin Cooper, clinical director of the San Jose Marital and Sexuality Center, \"The older man falls victim to Calvin Klein commercials with 14- or 15-year-old girls. The media make for a lot of sexual acting out in our society.\"\n\nThe policy in the New York City schools is quite clear on the penalty for employees who sexually abuse students, regardless of age.\n\n\"There's an absolute line,\" said John Ferrandino, superintendent of New York's high schools. \"Any kind of dating and sexual relations is a violation. We bring you up on charges, we throw you out, we get you arrested if we can.\"\n\nSchool employees are required to report all suspected abuse cases immediately to investigators. Yet the affairs continue to occur at a steady rate, school officials said.\n\n\"There are very many relationship cases we never hear about,\" said Regina Loughran, the special counsel handling Christina's case for the Special Investigator's office of the Board of Education. \"Very often, you hear about it only if the relationship goes bad.\"\n\nMs. Shakeshaft's study found that the teachers most likely to fall into sexual relationships with their students were those who spent time with them individually or after school: coaches, counselors and teachers of drama, art, music and gym.\n\nA sampling of recent relationship cases handled by Ms. Loughran's office demonstrated that. A track coach, David Drummond, at Automotive High School in Brooklyn pleaded guilty to third-degree rape after having sex with a 15-year-old female student. Others accused of abuse were a gym teacher, Andre Cadet, at Julia Richman High School in Manhattan; several young school safety officers, and a couple of guidance counselors. One counselor, Roger Krubiner of Park West High School, was accused of persuading a girl to have sex with him and pose for nude pictures.\n\nIn Christina's case, at least, her teacher, Glenn Harris, was apparently not playing with her. He ruined his career, spent all his money and tried to marry her.\n\nNot all stories of teacher-student romance end as badly as hers, with the teacher facing criminal charges, but to educators, what Mr. Harris did was undeniably wrong.\n\n\"It might be a cute love story,\" Mr. Ferrandino said, \"But, it's corny, but being a teacher is a sacred trust, and you have to handle it like that.\"",

        "instruction": "For almost two centuries Harper & Row has been an American publishing tradition, but these last several years must have seemed like the longest in that company's lengthy history.\n\nAngry employees went out on strike. Its publisher left for bigger and more prosperous Simon & Schuster. Its acquisition of the J.B. Lippincott Company looked to be a financial albatross. And its 50 percent reduction in trade titles resulted in the discharging of dozens of employees, including some editors who had been with the company for years.\n\nSo when Winthrop Knowlton recently announced that he would step down this summer as Harper chairman and chief executive, some book industry sources suggested he was preparing to abandon a sinking ship.\n\nYet for all its storm-tossed ventures, Harper still looks remarkably seaworthy. ''There's no question, things are certainly improving there after a pretty rocky couple of years,'' said John S. Reidy, publishing analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert.\n\nThat upbeat assessment is evident in the air of confidence that permeates the corridors of Harper & Row, in midtown Manhattan. In the past few months the company has reported vastly improved sales and earnings. It recently enticed a highly respected editor, Aaron Asher, away from Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Several Harper books are on or flirting with the best-seller list. And waiting in the wings, for publication next fall, is ''The Dean's December,'' Saul Bellow's first book since he switched to Harper three years ago after 30 years with the Viking Press. Books on Fall List\n\nThe strong fall list also includes ''An Indecent Obsession,'' the latest novel by Colleen McCullough, author of ''The Thorn Birds''; ''Collected Poems'' by Sylvia Plath; ''Poems and Sketches of E.B. White''; an autobiography of the singer Eddie Fisher; ''The Rare Art Traditions,'' a book about art history and collecting by Joseph Alsop; and ''Moments of Visions,'' a collection of cultural essays by Kenneth Clark.\n\nThese are a far cry from the kind of books often identified with Harper. ''It was known mostly for its memoirs of statesmen and politicians,'' said one well-regarded literary agent, ''and it never really was strong in fiction or belles-lettres.''\n\nBut the hiring of Mr. Asher, editor in chief at Farrar, Straus & Giroux for the last six years, is intended to change that image. Mr. Asher is highly regarded as a literary editor - so much so that when he left Holt, Rinehart & Winston for Farrar, Straus, the novelist Philip Roth went with him.\n\nAsked if he planned to rejoin Mr. Asher, Mr. Roth, in a recent telephone conversation from London: replied, ''My plan is to stay where I am. My book is coming out soon, and I haven't even begun another.'' (Mr. Roth's new novel, ''Zuckerman Unbound,'' is scheduled for publication in June.)\n\nMr. Asher said he did not want to comment specifically on Mr. Roth. ''But I'll certainly take seriously any authors from that excellent Farrar, Straus list who show an inclination to move,'' he said. He added that he did not want to restrict himself to fiction. ''I'm coming here as a generalist, as I was at Farrar, Straus,'' he said. Mr. Asher's first Harper acquisition is an autobiography by the actress Claire Bloom.\n\nThe Asher move to Harper is doubly notable for the fact that Roger W. Straus is chairman of Farrar, Straus, while his son, Roger Straus 3d, is editorial director of Harper & Row.\n\nMr. Asher acknowledged that his leaving the smaller but highly regarded Farrar, Straus resulted from ''differences of policy and differences of money,'' but he said he did not wish to discuss them. As for the other matter, ''I've known quite a lot of the major people in Harper's for many years,'' Mr. Asher said. ''It's probably amusing that there's a Roger Straus here, also, but there's nothing to be made of that. He, too, left his father's company four years ago and we overlapped there.'' 'You're an Awfully Good Poet'\n\nHarper made several attempts in years past to bolster its fiction lineup, but with little lasting success. ''We had John Updike with us as a poet,'' said M. S. Wyeth Jr., an editor who started as a salesman some 25 years ago. ''Then he came to his editor with a partial novel and she said something like, 'John, you're an awfully good poet.' The rest is history.''\n\nBut Mr. Wyeth, who shares the title of executive editor with Mr. Asher and Lawrence P. Ashmead, thinks that Harper has not done badly by fiction. ''After all, we had three of the best-selling novels of the last decade,'' he said, citing ''The Thorn Birds,'' ''Love Story'' by Erich Segal and ''The Exorcist'' by William Peter Blatty. Moreover, novels by Harper authors Wright Morris, Johanna Kaplan and Lynne Sharon Schwartz are finalists for the American Book Awards for fiction, while the Schwartz novel is also a nominee for the 1981 Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award.\n\nMr. Burlingame believes this recent showing is more than coincidence. ''I've made a deliberate policy for us to be strong in fiction, which I've been involved with all my career as an editor,'' he said.\n\nBut what particularly pleases Harper officials is that so far, at least, the doomsday financial predictions of a few years ago have not come true. Some Wall Streeters still think that in paying $16.2 million for Lippincott (one year after its 1977 acquisition of Thomas Y. Crowell publishers), Harper paid more than it should have, especially since the Lippincott auditors were subsequently censured by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly transforming a $2 million loss in 1977 into a slight profit. That loss added to a doubling of Harper's debt burden in 1979 and caused the company's earnings to plunge almost 37 percent.\n\nBut four months ago, Harper, one-third of whose stock is owned by the Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company, announced record revenues ($92.2 million) and income ($4.6 million) for the six months ended Oct. 31. Profits continued to rise during the third quarter ended Jan. 31, 1981.\n\nThat improvement is largely a reflection of Harper's success in incorporating Lippincott and Crowell. The company's technical, professional and medical books continue to appear under the Lippincott imprint and account for about 30 percent of Harper sales (compared with almost 35 percent for textbooks and 20 percent for trade books). Harper is now the third-largest medical publisher in the nation. An 'Arranged Marriage'\n\n''We have gone through a difficult period of an arranged marriage where partners didn't know each other well, and one of my jobs has been to get rid of the attitude of 'we' and 'you,' '' said Mr. Burlingame, himself a Lippincott alumnus.\n\nHe has succeeded admirably in the opinion of many, including Mr. Ashmead, a veteran editor who also came over from Lippincott. ''I thought Harper was not the kind of company that would appreciate an editor that leaned toward very commercial books, which is what I am,'' he said. ''For a while agents weren't sure that I was here to stay, but now they know and they are much more willing to sell me books. I spent an awful lot of money buying books the first year, and being allowed to do so helped build the kind of enthusiasm needed to show that Harper is definitely committed to trade publishing.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Eddie Fisher photo of Saul Bellow",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Aug. 10— The number of people in Federal prisons has begun to rise rather sharply after dropping steadily for several years. The director of the Federal prison system says that a new emphasis on prosecuting volent crime and narcotics cases is one reason for the increase.\n\nThe Federal prison population reached 26,186 last week, an increase of 8.4 percent, or 2,024 inmates, since the beginning of the fiscal year 1981 on Oct. 1, 1980. After reaching a high of more than 30,000 in 1977, the total had declined steadily to 24,162 at the end of the last fiscal year.\n\nNorman A. Carlson, who has been director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons for 11 years, said last week in an interview that he could not completely explain the sudden change. He did mention the increased emphasis on prosecution of violent crime and narcotics. But, ''in all candor,'' he went on, ''We are concerned about the situation and will consider the possibility of asking for more prison space if the population continues to increase.''\n\nRonald J. Waldron, planning director for the Bureau of Prisons, said he expected the increases to continue. ''It looks like an upward trend,'' not a statistical accident, he said. Plans to Put More in Jail\n\nAttorney General William French Smith said, at a confirmation hearing in January, that his ''top priority'' was the national effort against violent crime.\n\nSpeaking last month to the National District Attorneys Association, Mr. Smith said simply, ''We intend to insure that more criminals go to jail.''\n\nBut, he said, ''the public must and, I believe, will come to recognize the need for new and improved correctional facilities.'' The 42 existing Federal institutions have a ''rated capacity'' of 23,586. That is the number of inmates they can accommodate while meeting Bureau of Prisons standards.\n\nMr. Carlson mentioned two other reasons for the increased number of Federal inmates. The prisons have accepted 390 Haitians from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and 175 inmates from overcrowded state and local correctional facilities, he said.\n\nThe Carter Administration placed primary emphasis on such whitecollar crimes as fraud and official corruption. Paradoxically, that approach led to a decline in the prison population. 'Quality Over Quantity'\n\nThose convicted of white-collar offenses have tended to draw shorter sentences than violent criminals, though in response to the recommendations of prosecutors, judges have begun to impose harsher punishment for these crimes than they once did.\n\nAnother factor in the decline in number of prisoners was Federal prosecutors' gains in winning convictions in complex commercial and nonviolent offenses. This trend involved stressing ''quality over quantity,'' meaning that there were fewer criminal cases filed and fewer defendants to imprison.\n\nIn the Carter Administration, Justice Department officals often encouraged United States attorneys to leave bank robberies, auto thefts and similar crimes to local prosecutors. Mr. Smith has called that ''elitist.''\n\n''United States attorneys have focused upon the so-called substantial, challenging case,'' Mr. Smith said recently. ''They have declined to prosecute the more mundane case.'' As an example, he said, prosecutors sometimes refused to handle cases involving relatively small amounts of heroin. Cases Go to States, Localities\n\nAs a result, he said, ''many cases that could be dealt with in the Federal system are processed through state and local criminal justice systems whose resources and facilities are at the breaking point.''\n\nMr. Smith is telling new United States attorneys to make a point of consulting, in a formal, structured way, with state and local prosecutors and police officials. This could lead to an increase in the Federal caseload, according to Justice Department lawyers.\n\nPresident Reagan has been in office less than seven months and he has replaced fewer than one-fourth of the 94 United States attorneys. But Justice Department and court officials said that the shift in prosecutorial priorities was already showing up in prison statistics because, under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, Federal judges have only 100 days to process a criminal case from arrest to the start of trial.\n\nNinety-five percent of the criminal cases are being processed within 100 days, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Still More May Be Jailed\n\nIn their eagerness to attack violent crime, Administration officials may endorse changes likely to put more people in Federal prisons and jails. That would be the predictable effect of several recommendations by the Attorney General's Task Force on Violent Crime.\n\nThe advisory panel, which met last week in New York City, concluded that there should be a mandatory sentence for the use of a firearm in the commission of a Federal felony.\n\nIt also said that judges should be allowed to deny bail or to set high bail for defendants who pose a danger to the community. In addition, the panel said that the Federal Government should have the first opportunity to prosecute juveniles who commit serious Federal crimes. At present, such youngsters are ordinarily turned over to state authorities.\n\nThe Federal prison population has gone up and down over the years, rising from 17,463 in 1949 to 24,925 in 1961, then falling to 19,822 in 1967 and climbing above 30,000 in 1977. The long period of decline occurred when the total United States population was growing.\n\nBut demographic analyses of prison statistics are complex. The size of the prison population seems to be more closely related to the number of people in certain crime-prone age brackets than to the size of the whole population.",

        "instruction": "HARTFORD, Nov. 24— For the second time in less than a year, health problems of a Governor have created political uncertainties in Connecticut and raised questions about how the state government can function without the active participation of its chief executive.\n\nLast Saturday, it was announced that Gov. William A. O'Neill had suffered a mild heart attack and had been hospitalized. Eleven months earlier, as Lieutenant Governor, he succeeded Ella T. Grasso, who was dying of cancer. Mrs. Grasso resigned last Dec. 31 and died Feb. 5.\n\nThe reports from St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center on the condition of the 51-year-old Mr. O'Neill have been encouraging. He was moved out of the coronary care unit on Monday, and today he had his first visitors from the State Capitol, Lieut. Gov. Joseph J. Fauliso and Charles M. McCollam Jr., the Governor's executive aide.\n\nBut the Governor's recuperation is expected to be lengthy, and it will put him on the sidelines during a critical portion of the political and legislative calendars. Had Called Special Session\n\nMr. O'Neill had just called the General Assembly into special session and asked it to vote $83 million in tax increases to close a budget deficit in the state's current fiscal year. He also had been expected, after the first of the year, to begin his campaign for election to a full term next November.\n\nThe Governor's doctors said victims of mild heart attacks were usually hospitalized 12 to 14 days and required up to three months before resuming a normal schedule. That would keep Mr. O'Neill out of the intensive negotiations that are likely to be needed for his tax proposals to have any chance of passage by the Democratic majorities of both houses of the General Assembly.\n\nEven before the Governor's heart attack, legislative leaders were forecasting serious problems in passing his proposals. After he was stricken, Lieutenant Governor Fauliso told reporters: ''I will do everything I can to sell the Governor's proposal. I hope that I can do it effectively.''\n\nThe timetable and the course of recuperation also could delay Mr. O'Neill's decision on whether to seek election to a full term. 4 Republicans in Running\n\nAfter the Governor was hospitalized, his only prospective challenger for the Democratic nomination at the moment, Ernest N. Abate of Stamford, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, issued a statement wishing him a speedy and full recovery.\n\nOn the Republican side, however, the campaigns of at least four gubernatorial candidates already have begun and will be continuing while the Democrats await word from Mr. O'Neill. They are State Senators Russell L. Post Jr. of Canton and Gerald Labriola of Naugatuck, and two former minority leaders of the State Senate, Lewis B. Rome of Bloomfield and Richard C. Bozzuto of Watertown.\n\nAside from the political uncertainties, the hospitalization of the Governor also generated some initial confusion about who was running the state government.\n\nUnder the State Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor takes over ''in the case of the inability of the Governor to exercise the powers and perform the duties of his office.'' There is nothing in state law, however, to determine when the Governor is unable to perform his duties. During her illness, Mrs. Grasso continued to handle paperwork and make decisions, and she was not isolated as Mr. O'Neill was over the weekend. Hospital Foresaw Isolation\n\nOn Saturday Mr. O'Neill's doctors said he would be kept isolated from state business to avoid stress. But on Monday Mr. Fauliso and other state officials maintained that Mr. O'Neill was still in charge.\n\n''I'm the Lieutenant Governor,'' Mr. Fauliso said. ''He is the Governor, is governing and will continue to govern.'' The Lieutenant Governor also said some paperwork might be sent to the Governor today, which brought expressions of surprise from officials at the hospital.\n\nLarrye deBear, the Governor's press secretary, explained later that if a decision had to be made by the Governor and Mr. O'Neill was not available, then the Lieutenant Governor would make it after consultation with the Governor's staff and the appropriate department heads.\n\nBy today, however, some of the confusion had subsided. The doctors said total isolation from the State Capitol ''could possibly create more stress than the performance of limited necessary legal duties.''\n\nMr. Fauliso and Mr. McCollam spent 20 minutes with the Governor this morning. They said Mr. O'Neill had signed an extradition form, had discussed events at which Mr. Fauliso would substitute for the Governor and had talked about the General Assembly's special session.\n\n''He looks good and is feeling better,'' Mr. Fauliso said. ''It was like talking to him downstairs in his office.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Joseph J. Fauliso",

        "instruction": "Fans of the 1992 “Sister Act” movie starring Whoopi Goldberg will find that the touring musical coming to the Opera House this week moves to a different beat. Out with the Motown pastiche, in with the disco.\n\nRock and soul have fluid, syncopated rhythms, says the stage adaptation’s composer, Alan Menken. With disco, though, “all of a sudden it was just: Boom. Boom. Boom. On the beat,” he says. “I found the ’70s music in general to be something that just tickled me. It was so dance-oriented. It was the underscore for a whole other kind of culture.”\n\nA culture, he explains by phone from his office just north of New York City, that becomes more entertaining with time.\n\n“You have to wait about 30 years, and then the style suggests so many things that we look back at fondly but also laugh at,” Menken says. “You think about disco, and you think about bell-bottoms, and those haircuts! The mullets!”\n\nIn the movie “Sister Act,” whose original music is by Marc Shaiman (“Hairspray”), Goldberg stars as Deloris van Cartier, a Reno lounge singer who witnesses a murder and gets taken into witness protection in the one place no one would ever look for her: a convent.\n\nThe musical takes basically the same path, although the action has moved to Philadelphia and Deloris is a budding disco star. The role will be played here by Ta’Rea Campbell, whose Broadway credits include “Leap of Faith” and “The Book of Mormon.”\n\n“Deloris van Cartier is a fiery diva,” says Campbell, from a tour stop in North Carolina. “She wants to be famous, and she wants to be fabulous, and she wants to be a star. And in her mind she already is, so it’s kind of a shock to her that she’s not headlining clubs.”\n\nComposer Alan Menken (below), discussing the show’s score, said ’70s music was “something that just tickled me. It was so dance-oriented.”\n\nDeloris is also already dissatisfied with her boyfriend, shady nightclub owner Curtis (Kingsley Leggs), when she witnesses his involvement in a murder. She turns to the police, and then it’s off to the convent until it’s time to testify. But if Mother Superior (Hollis Resnick) thinks being “Here Within These Walls” is going to change Deloris, it’s mostly the other way around. Naturally, Deloris helps the nuns find their groove, despite the gangsters on her trail.\n\n“I think that Deloris is really, really honest, and she says exactly what she feels when she feels it,” Campbell says. “It’s a really strong quality that she has, but it also gets her in a lot of trouble sometimes. That’s where the battle comes; that’s where the funny struggle happens between her and Mother Superior.”\n\nAfter early productions in Pasadena, Calif., where the musical premiered in 2006, and Atlanta, “Sister Act” ran for more than a year in London’s West End, finally arriving at its intended destination on Broadway under the direction of Jerry Zaks in 2011.\n\nThat production’s Deloris was Patina Miller, now performing as the Leading Player in “Pippin” at the American Repertory Theater before moving with the revival to Broadway. Miller received one of the show’s five Tony Award nominations, as did the team of Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater.\n\nGoldberg is a producer of the “Sister Act” musical, and also spent a few weeks performing in the show in London — but this time she played Mother Superior, the Maggie Smith role in the movie.\n\nMenken says the show coming to Boston is very much the Broadway production. The musical director, Brent-Alan Huffman, conducted the show on Broadway, and several cast members are carryovers as well.\n\nMenken is best known for his work on Disney animated hits including “Aladdin,” “Beauty and the Beast,” and “The Little Mermaid,” earning a shelf of Oscars, Grammys, and Golden Globes along the way, and adapting many for the stage.\n\n“Truth be told, ‘Sister Act’ is the first musical I’ve written directly for the Broadway stage,” he says. “Everything else was an adaptation of something I wrote for film or wrote for off-Broadway, or, in one case, an oratorio I did. ‘A Christmas Carol’ is Broadway, I guess, but that played Madison Square Garden, so it’s a little different.”\n\nHe was approached to work on the show by Peter Schneider, a former Disney executive who had worked with him decades earlier on “Little Shop of Horrors” off-Broadway. “At first I was resistant to it, because it’s already got songs that are so well known,” but the challenge of writing a new score and giving the characters a new voice was irresistible, Menken says.\n\n“I like to think, when you get to a certain musical number in a musical, if you turn off the words and just hear the music, the music itself should give you about 50 percent of what you’re going to get dramatically,” he says.\n\nWith Slater, he also came up with a few twists on that formula, notably in “When I Find My Baby.”\n\n“For me there always should be a moment for the audience of ‘Oh, I get it!’ ” Menken says with a laugh. “Curtis is singing a song that’s a kind of hearts-and-flowers kinda love song, but it’s about ‘how I wanna dismember the girl because she’s turned against me.’ ”\n\nIn fact, Menken says, pure disco is a relatively small part of the show’s score. As a working pianist and beginning composer in New York in the ’70s, he had to get to know the new sounds, but he wasn’t going out to discos except for the occasional professional obligation, much less hanging at Studio 54. Unsurprisingly, then, his “Sister Act” compositions run the musical gamut of that decade. “It’s got all those ’70s styles,” he says, “from disco to funk to psychedelic soul to the smooth jazz, where I think of Lou Rawls, and there’s traditional musical theater as well.”\n\nThe newest Deloris seems to welcome the variety.\n\n“It’s such fun to sing, I’m having a blast,” says Campbell. “It’s really easy to just fall right into that groove.”",

Ewan McGregor plays Edward as a young man.\n\nBurton (\"Beetlejuice,\" \"Edward Scissorhands\") straddles the line Â­between the real and surreal, offering strange beings like an elderly woman whose one eye can foresee the Â­manner of someone's death and a gentle giant about 12 feet tall.\n\nThe DVD, due out Tuesday, shows Burton on the set and has Â­interviews with the cast, which includes Â­Danny DeVito, Jessica Lange, Alison Â­Lohman and Helena Bonham Carter. Burton's commentary is in the form of an Â­interview, but it is keyed to what's on screen.\n\nTuesday will be a good day for the undead. Several sets of classic Â­horror films arrive.\n\nUniversal pulls out its big guns with \"Monster Legacy Collections\" ($26.98 each) devoted to \"Dracula,\" Â­\"Frankenstein\" and \"The Wolf Man.\" Each double-DVD includes multiple sequels and new documentaries and Â­commentaries. (The \"Dracula\" set boasts the 1931 Spanish-language version.)\n\nThe British answer to Universal is represented by \"The Hammer Horror Collection\" (Warner, six disks, $68.92, $19.97 individually), containing such Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing faves as \"Taste the Blood of Dracula,\" \"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed\" and \"Dracula Has Risen From the Grave.\"\n\nAnd making its DVD debut is 1939's \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (MPI, 80 mins., $19.98), starring Basil Rathbone in his initial outing as Sherlock Holmes and featuring one frightening canine.\n\nIn an interview on the DVD of \"The Cooler,\" William H. Macy says he Â­didn't want to play another Â­loser. But after reading the screenplay, he thought, \"Well, if you're not going to play losers, play at least this one ... because this guy is an uber-loser.\"\n\nIn Wayne Kramer's Las Vegas drama, out on DVD Tuesday (Lions Gate, 102 mins., R, $26.99), the sad-faced Macy plays Bernie, a most valuable Â­casino Â­employee: a guy with such bad luck, all he has to do is stand near a \"hot\" table to instantly turn the dice or cards cold. Alec Baldwin was Oscar-nominated for his portrayal of the brutal casino boss who directs Bernie around the floor. Â­Maria Bello co-stars as a beautiful Â­cocktail Â­waitress drawn to the sensitive guy; Â­getting lucky in love, though, can ruin a cooler's career.\n\nThe disk has filmmaker Â­commentaries, deleted scenes and a Sundance Channel \"Anatomy of a Scene.\"\n\nFilmmakers Peter and Bobby Â­Farrelly (\"There's Something About Mary,\" \"ShallowÂ­ Hal\") again delve into the humor inherent in the human body in \"Stuck on You,\" coming to DVD Tuesday (Fox, 119 mins., PG-13, $27.98). Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear play conjoined twins, Bob and Walt, who own a burger joint on Martha's Vineyard and whose outlook is remarkably sunny considering they share a liver. Walt has the acting bug, so they head to Hollywood, leading to a string of audition humiliations and celebrity encounters.\n\nThe DVD has commentary by the Farrellys, deleted scenes and, most important, a look at the makeup and devices that helped pull off the Siamese stunt.\n\nLOVE ACTUALLY (Universal, 135 mins., R, $26.98) Richard Curtis, the writer of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" makes his directing debut with this ambitious\n\ncomedy-drama that juggles a dozen major characters searching for love in London. Introducing the deleted scenes, Curtis says the movie Â­initially ran 31/2 hours. He and stars Hugh Grant (the bachelor prime minister), Bill Nighy (an aging rock star) and Thomas Sangster (a lovesick little boy) provide commentary. The big cast also includes Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley and a few surprises.\n\nLOVE DON'T COST A THING (Warner, 100 mins., PG-13, $27.95) In this remake of the 1987 teen comedy \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" high-school nerd Alvin (Nick Cannon) pays the prettiest girl in school (Christina Milian) to pretend to be his girlfriend so he can look cool. Steve Harvey, as Alvin's dad, is amusing, but his sex tips offer way too much information. The DVD has deleted scenes, including a different ending.\n\nTHE STATEMENT (Columbia TriStar, 120 mins., R, $26.96) Michael Caine has played bad guys in his long career, but his fugitive Nazi executioner here may be his worst. Tilda Swinton and Jeremy Northam play a French judge and colonel, respectively, who go after aged Pierre Brossard decades after his war crimes. Disk extras include commentary by director Norman Jewison and deleted scenes.\n\nGHOSTS OF THE ABYSS (Disney 61 mins., PG, $29.99) \"Titanic\" director James Cameron and star Bill Paxton take state-of-the-art submersibles down to the bottom of the North Atlantic to see the real wreck. The documentary was a 3-D IMAX attraction in theaters, but is in 2-D for video. The double DVD includes the theatrical cut as well as a 92-minute version.\n\nOSAMA (MGM, 83 mins., PG-13, $29.98) During the Taliban era in Afghanistan, a female Â­doctor, no longer allowed to work, disguises her 12-year-old Â­daughter as a boy\n\nso she'll be (comparatively) free to scrounge for work and food.

Florio of Runnemede, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor in the June 2 primary.\n\nThe letters, mailed to an estimated 50,000 association members in New Jersey, singled out Mr. Florio from the 13 Democratic candidates, but said that any of the eight candidates for the Republican nomination would also satisfy the association.\n\nThe election commission received complaints about the mailing from two of Mr. Florio's opponents - the State Senate President, Joseph P. Merlino, and John J. Degnan, the former Attorney General. The state's new campaign financing law includes an $800 limit on contributions, and the complaints say that the cost of the mailing exceeded the limit.\n\nLewis B. Thurston, executive director of the commission, said he had already contacted the association for information. He said the complaint from Mr. Merlino had been directed at both Mr. Florio's campaign and the Rifle Association, while the Degnan complaint had been aimed chiefly at the association's action.\n\nIf the commission finds merit to the complaints, it could handle the matter administratively by requiring the Florio campaign to deduct the cost of the mailing from its campaign spending limit. The commission could also file a criminal complaint if it found a willful attempt to violate the election statutes, or impose a fine of up to $1,000 if the violation was not willful.\n\nJames Maloney, a spokesman for Mr. Florio, called the complaints ''a desperate attempt to create an issue in the closing stages of the campaign.'' Mr. Maloney said the Florio campaign staff knew nothing of the Rifle Association mailing and had not participated in it in any way.",

You go to a movie, of course, with the understanding that on holidays old movies are better than new movies, and old movie musicals are best of all. The Hollywood Twin Cinema (246-0717), at Eighth Avenue and 47th Street, is showing ''An American in Paris'' and ''Les Girls.'' ''American in Paris,'' with Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, is famous for a truly pretentious ballet number, but it has music by George Gershwin, so how awful could it be? In 1951 it won an Academy Award as best picture of the year. The 1957 ''Les Girls'' also stars Mr. Kelly, along with Kay Kendall, Taina Elg and Mitzi Gaynor. The dancing isn't what it ought to be, even though Jack Cole was the choreographer, but Miss Kendall is wonderful, and the score is by Cole Porter. George Cukor directed.\n\nFor truly epic entertainment, meanwhile, there is ''Mutiny on the Bounty,'' along with ''China Seas,'' at the Regency (724-3700), Broadway and 67th Street. If you haven't seen the 1935 ''Mutiny'' (there was a pallid remake in 1962, with Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard), you haven't seen Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh or Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian. Mr. Laughton, who wears the expression of someone smelling something vile, is wonderful. Largely because of him, ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' won its Academy Award as best picture of the year. ''China Seas,'' also 1935, also co-stars Mr. Gable, again as a ship's officer. This time, however, he is pursued by Rosalind Russell and Jean Harlow. Miss Harlow, who is wisecracking and funny, wins. The supporting players include Wallace Beery, Lewis Stone, Robert Benchley, C. Aubrey Smith, Akim Tamiroff and Donald Meek.\n\nAt the Thalia (222-3370), at Broadway at 95th Street, there are two by Katharine Hepburn, both unlike anything you probably have seen Miss Hepburn in before. In ''Christopher Strong'' (1933), Miss Hepburn is a British aviatrix who commits suicide. The love of her life, meanwhile, is Colin Clive, who a few movies before this was the first Baron Frankenstein. In ''Sylvia Scarlett'' (1936), Miss Hepburn is the boyish-looking daughter of Edmund Gwenn. The movie, which was directed by Cukor, also stars Cary Grant, Brian Aherne, Dennie Moore and Natalie Paley. Miss Hepburn, Miss Moore, Mr. Grant and Mr. Gwenn get to sing a ballad together. TURKEY AT ROSELAND\n\nFor traditionalists, what could be more traditional than Roseland? The big ballroom at 239 West 52d Street, just west of Broadway, is now in its 61st year. Ordinarily, Thursdays are the quietest days of the week at Roseland, but today it is having a Thanksgiving dinner and dance. The doors open at 2:30 P.M., and dinner will be served from 3 P.M. on. The price for dinner (turkey and everything that is supposed to go with it) and dancing is $12.95. If you prefer to pass up dinner and just dance, the price is $5. Either way, by New York standards it is a bargain. The dancing, which will be to the music of two alternating orchestras, ends at midnight. For reservations or information, call 247-0200. 'RENT' DUE\n\n''Rent,'' a new comedy by Walter Corwin, begins previews tonight at the Theater for the New City, at 162 Second Avenue, at 10th Street. The play, which features Tony Allon, Julie Ariola, Barry Einstein, Robert Frink and Norman Kruger, is about a married couple who are the tenants of the last rent-controlled apartment in New York. The play is directed by Carol Ilson. The previews run tonight through Sunday, with the opening next Thursday. Then it runs through Dec. 6, and from Dec. 10-13. All performances begin at 8 P.M., and admission is $4 or by a Theater Development Fund voucher. For reservations, call 254-1109.\n\nFor Entertainment Events, see page C19.

        "instruction": "OF the Japanese composers who have emerged on the international scene since World War II, Toru Takemitsu is the best known in this country, and perhaps the best. His Requiem for Strings, ''November Steps'' and ''Green'' made the rounds of the major orchestras a decade or so ago; record collectors know a few pieces such as his ''Asterism'' and ''Stanza I,'' and film enthusiasts may recognize him as the composer of music for ''Woman in the Dunes,'' among other films. Those works, however, hardly scratch the skin of Mr. Takemitsu's substantial body of work. In fact, like many of his Western colleagues, he has spent the last 30 years or so in trying on one compositional style after another, like a dandy who has been let loose overnight in a tailor's shop.\n\nIf it was going around, Mr. Takemitsu tried it: musique concrete, silences and chance in the John Cage manner, electronics, improvisation, graphic notatio, and theatrical gestures. He wrote for traditional Japanese instruments such as the biwa and shakuhachi as well as for all sorts of Western instruments and choruses. Monday night at Carnegie Hall Mr. Takemitsu's most recent style went on display when the Tokyo String Quartet gave the world premiere of his ''A way a lone'' (1980), commissioned by the Tokyo for its 10th anniversary last season. The title remained wrapped in an enigma even after the program notes pointed out that it derived from ''Finnegans Wake'': ''The keys to. Given! A way a lone a last a long the.'' Otherwise, the one-movement, 15-minute piece presented few puzzles: in spite of its fairly complex rhythmic schemes, the rapid changes of meter sounded natural and somehow not arbitrary.\n\nMr. Takemitsu's piece concentrates, like most of his music, on playing with sonorities in extremely refined and sensitive ways. The mood of ''A way a lone'' continually puts one in mind of Berg's ''Lyric Quartet,'' though the textures are thinner, in the fashion of Webern. The notation is precise and fully spelled out (no aleatory ad libbing allowed in this one), and much use is made of the plaintive and eerie whistle of string harmonics. The music, while systematically atonal and charged with a muted but suffocating intensity, makes a strong and immediate appeal. The Tokyo Quartet made it sound easy, although this is a score in which almost every measure has dynamic or expressive changes and the writing for strings often suggests the middle Bartok quartets in technical difficulty. Mr. Takemitsu joined the Tokyo onstage after the premiere to acknowledge the applause of a crowded house - stage seating accommodated part of the audience.\n\nThe size of the audience was a token of the Tokyo's standing among the world's string quartets. It is a remarkably well-balanced foursome in every way, managing to achieve both the homogeneity of tone that fine quartets strive for as well as the distinctiveness of each instrument's line, without which that homogeneity can turn to musical mush. A rarely played quartet in E-flat (Op. 125, No. 1) that Schubert wrote when he was 16 showed the Tokyo's lyrically Classic style and the Brahms Quartet in C minor (Op. 51, No. 1) closed the night in a studiously Romantic mood. The Tokyo's corporate temperament seemed better suited to the Schubert than to the Brahms, which was superbly tailored but lacked the unpredictable surges, pained lyricism and dark mutterings that can keep Brahms at his academic driest from being a glum bore.

        "instruction": "BOSTON, Nov. 8— When John R. Silber came up from Texas 10 years ago to become president of Boston University, the nation's fourth largest private university, he told the board of trustees that he had been called in very late. ''The patient is already on the operating table and could be moribund,'' the former philosophy professor warned at the time.\n\nThe university had a tiny endowment, a growing deficit, a declining student enrollment and a reputation as a mediocre city-streetcar college on an ugly campus in the intellectual shadow of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology across the Charles River in Cambridge. Mr. Silber advised that the only remedy was to install firm management and to strive to attract better faculty and students.\n\nLast night more than 300 trustees, alumni, professors and celebrities, including Angela Lansbury, the actress, and Oriana Fallaci, the writer, gathered at a black-tie gala to celebrate Mr. Silber's 10th anniversary as president. But, symbolic of the stormy past decade, about 100 members of the school's service employees' union and students protested outside the Mugar Library where the party was held. Many carried placards that read, ''B.U. Administration Is Repressive.''\n\nThe focus of their protest was Mr. Silber, an articulate, pugnacious 54-year-old who sprinkles his conversation with quotations from Greek philosophy and English literature, and who runs the university in an authoritarian style that has engendered more than one campus controversy. Vote on Faculty Contract Due\n\nThe latest example is that tomorrow the school's 1,507-member faculty is scheduled to vote on whether to accept a proposed new pay package from the school or go on strike, a highly unusual action for a major university. The faculty union struck briefly in 1979 when the last contract expired.\n\nThe immediate issue is the 9 percent raise the administration has offered the faculty for each of the next three years. Although average faculty salaries place Boston Universty in the top 15 percent of American schools, there are wide discrepancies within the university. For example, annual wages for a full professor range from $26,000 to $55,000, depending on several factors. Behind the salary issue is the visceral distrust and dislike many professors say they feel for Mr. Silber.\n\nThe faculty's general distaste for Mr. Silber grew so pronounced that in the past five years it has twice voted to dismiss him. ''I think John Silber has tried to run B.U. as an authoritarian factory,'' asserted Frances Fox Piven, a professor of political science. ''He's bred fear and created demoralization.'' Has Support of Trustees\n\nMr. Silber survived the faculty votes against him because it has no legal power to dismiss him and because he has strong support of key members of the board of trustees.\n\nHe has also outlasted the resignations or dismissals of virtually all of the academic deans and vice presidents who were at the school when he came.\n\nMr. Silber does have supporters among the faculty. William V. Shannon, Ambassador to Ireland in the Carter Administration, was selected earlier this year by Mr. Silber to be a ''university professor'' under a special program, started and controlled by Mr. Silber.\n\n''He is a very dynamic administrator,'' Mr. Shannon said, ''with a mental picture of what he wants in the way of excellence. If you want to change the quality and direction of a university deptartment, you may get into a real fight with the faculty.''\n\nSome professors say the larger question is whether, in a time of inflation, recession and reduced Government aid to education, it is possible to combine strong and economically sound management with a tradition of open academia and faculty governance.\n\nBy most accounts, Mr. Silber has accomplished his key objectives. He has added several distinguished professors to the faculty, such as Elie Wiesel, the specialist on the Holocaust and Judaica, and Hermann F. Eilts, the former Ambassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who helped negotiate the Camp David peace accords.\n\nMr. Silber has balanced the university budget and has raised the endowment to $62.7 million today from $18.8 million in 1971. The university was founded in 1839 by the Methodist Church.\n\nHe is also credited with helping to raise the quality of the school's 22,409 students and increasing the number who come from outside Massachusetts.\n\nDespite Mr. Silber's accomplishments, many professors deeply resent what they say has been his arbitrary interference in their customary prerogatives of determining promotion, salary increases and tenure for fellow faculty members.\n\nAccording to a memorandum circulated by Professor Piven, Mr. Silber has turned down tenure for all three candidates that the political science department advanced from among its junior faculty in the last 10 years. The young professors had already been approved by their department, by a university-wide advisory committee and by the dean of the College of Liberal Arts.\n\nAt most universities, Professor Piven said in an interview, the president would accept such recommendations as a matter of course. 'Wants to Penalize' Critics\n\n''Silber wants to penalize us for being his critics,'' Professor Piven asserted. ''He has created so much fear we are even afraid we won't be able to get sabbaticals.''\n\nIn an interview in his mahogany-paneled office overlooking the choppy blue waters of the Charles River, Mr. Silber defended his actions on granting of tenure. ''I know that I would be thought negligent if I didn't inspect a $3 million building we were buying,'' he said. ''But when we give tenure to a faculty member at the age of 35, we are investing $2 to $3 million in them.''\n\nIn the conflict over the university's proposed new wage offer, Mr. Silber has remained uncharacteristically quiet. Faculty members believe it is because he is confident their union will soon be declared illegal as a bargaining agent by the National Labor Relations Board under a 1980 Supreme Court ruling involving Yeshiva University in New York. The court held that professors are managers rather than employees and therefore are not entitled to be represented by labor unions.\n\nMr. Silber said his reticence on the possible strike vote was a result of advice given him by the chairman of the board of trustees, Arthur Metcalf, the president of the Electronics Corporation of America and one of Mr. Silber's staunchest backers.\n\n''He said the trouble with me was that I didn't understand anything about physics,'' Mr. Silber said, ''that when a pendulum swings toward me, I try to stop it by shoving back.'' The administrator said Mr. Metcalf told him that such action only added new energy to the swinging, and that ''the way to stop it is to place a piece of felt under the bottom of the pendulum so it just grazes it,'' until it slows to a halt.\n\n''He said that anytime anybody says something to me, I feel I have to answer back and that injects more energy.'' So Mr. Silber said he hoped that his staying out of the present argument would make the faculty focus on the real issue, which he said was how the school could cope with the cutbacks in aid to education by the Reagan Administration.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Angela Lansbury with John R.

It went on from there to dominate the French labor movement and the left.\n\nThe full consequences of the election May 10 of Francois Mitterrand, France's Socialist President, have only begun to be played out in the complex web of the Communist Party's internal and external relationships. But a number of important things have already happened.\n\nFrom Criticism to Offers of Help\n\nWith great suddenness, the party line toward Mr. Mitterrand has changed from bitter opposition to offers of help that have daily become more unconditional. An openly critical movement, complete with its own newspaper, has emerged within the party. And rumors of a shake-up in the Communist Party leadership have become increasingly insistent.\n\nThe Communists, who went into the presidential election on an almost equal footing with the Socialists, ended up with 15 percent of the vote. The Socialists got more than 26 percent. A quarter of the Communist Party's customary supporters deserted it and helped elect Mr. Mitterrand.\n\nIt was a setback for the policies of Georges Marchais, the party leader. In the mid-1970's the Communists joined forces with the Socialists in the hope that a united left could win power. In 1978 Mr. Marchais, suspecting that unity was chiefly benefiting the Socialists, imposed a radical shift. He denounced the Socialists as little better than conservatives and called for class struggle and loyalty to the Soviet Union. The result was that Communist voters deserted to Mr. Mitterrand in droves. Another Shift in Strategy\n\nOver the last few weeks, the party line has shifted once more. Party leaders hailed Mr. Mitterrand's victory as if it was their own. They have promised cooperation and have increasingly dropped their insistence that portions of their own program be implemented. Above all, they have begun to water down their original demand that the Socialists include them in the Cabinet that will be formed after the legislative elections, which are expected to be held June 14 and 21 under France's two-round system.\n\nFor their part, the Socialists are playing tough. Socialist leaders have not ruled out the possibility of minor Communist participation in a future Government. But the conditions that they are setting are so stiff - opposition to the Soviet actions in Afghanistan and Poland, support for the Western position on nuclear missiles in Europe, limitations on nationalization - that it seems unlikely that the Communists will agree to them.\n\nThe Communists, however, are sounding more and more conciliatory. The other day, for example, one Communist leader spoke of the need for self-determination in Afghanistan.\n\nThere is no question that it is a critical time for the Communist Party leadership, and there have been numerous rumors of an imminent change. Paul Laurent, one of the few liberals in the leadership, has reappeared on the scene after having been absent for a while. Rene Andrieu, editor of L'Humanite, the official Communist Party newspaper, took an oddly timed two-week vacation just after the election. An Openly Critical Newspaper\n\nThere has been another development that is more concrete, and perhaps more interesting. Five flights up a rickety wooden staircase, in the shabby reaches beyond Place de la Republique, a middle-level Communist official named Henri Fiszbin has undertaken a campaign that is quite novel in the recent history of the French Communist Party.\n\nTwo weeks ago, with the help of some 30 like-minded Communists, he began to publish a weekly newspaper that takes issue with the tactics of the party's leaders. The newspaper has criticized their arbitrary ways and their failure to tolerate democratic discussion among the membership.\n\nMr. Fiszbin, a mild-mannered and fierce-minded man in his 50's, is not a former Communist. He has neither resigned nor been expelled from the party. He is a member of the Central Committee of the party's Paris federation and a Communist member on the Paris City Council. Mr. Fiszbin's collaborators are also active members of the party, although, he said, ''we find the atmosphere fairly tense when we go to meetings.''\n\nMr. Fiszbin and his associates, many of them Communist journalists and all of them associated with the more liberal elements within the party, have criticized the leadership for moving away from the relative openness that prevailed in the mid-1970's and that was adopted as policy by the 22d Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in 1976. That Congress called for wide cooperation with the Socialists and, as a kind of corollary, for a more democratic party. He Waits Until After Election\n\nMr. Fiszbin was a noted, though relatively cautious, critic of the hard-line shift by Mr. Marchais. He said that because he did not wish to divide the party before the presidential elections, he had refrained from coming out with his newspaper until two weeks ago.\n\nThe party's new attitude has nullified part of his quarrel with the leadership. There remain, however, the issues of the lack of free discussion within the party and the refusal of the leadership to consult with the members.\n\n''It is true that L'Humanite has come out for a policy of cooperation with the Socialists,'' Mr. Fiszbin said. ''But they did it by the same old authoritarian methods.''\n\nHe agreed that the party had never been as democratic as he said it should be, but he argued that at the time of the 22d Congress of the Soviet Communist Party it was making real progress toward opening itself and that that progress should continue.\n\nIt is not the custom of the French Communist Party, at least not in recent years, to permit organized criticism within its ranks. If no disciplinary action has been taken against Mr. Fiszbin and his associates, it is generally believed that this is because the leadership is divided and unsure of its support.",

        "instruction": "So you’re rummaging through the fridge and come across that absurdly expensive bottle of raw green juice (here’s why you should never go on a juice cleanse) that you somehow felt compelled to buy last week. But now it’s past the “use by” date on the bottle.\n\nDo you really need to toss it?\n\nPainful as it is to throw away any food — especially pricey food — the answer is a big, fat, unfortunate yes.\n\n“As a general rule of thumb, eating foods after their ‘use by’ or expiration date that are fresh, unprocessed, and have been handled frequently isn’t worth the risk — and some are riskier than others,” says Deborah Orlick Levy, RD, health and nutrition consultant for Carrington Farms. Foods that were processed for longer shelf life (e.g., frozen foods, canned foods and dried pasta), on the other hand, are most likely okay a bit past the date, provided they were stored appropriately.\n\nThe following seven foods can be downright dangerous if eaten past their prime.\n\nThat refreshing raw, cold-pressed juice you love so much should never be consumed after the date on the bottle — often only two to five days after it’s made. Because these juices are unpasteurized, they’re far more prone to contamination by bacteria or yeast, says Jessica Levinson, RD, nutritionist at Nutritioulicious. High pressure processed juices, on the other hand, last a bit longer, 30 to 45 days, but should still be consumed by the date.\n\nPhoto: ShutterstockFresh strawberries, blueberries or raspberries are fiber- and antioxidant-rich superfoods, but they can also carry a parasite called cyclospora, says Levy, which causes diarrhea, vomiting, bloating and other nasty flulike symptoms. (Here are 6 foods that can make you seriously sick.) Wash berries before eating and never consume after the use-by date, or after they begin to break down or grow mold. Save yourself money by freezing fresh berries you know you won’t eat in time.\n\nUnless you’re buying prepackaged deli meat in air-tight packaging (this doesn’t include what you buy at the deli counter), those hickory smoked turkey slices are only going to last you about three to five days, says Londa Nwadike, PhD, food safety specialist for Kansas State University and the University of Missouri. Don’t wait for it to get slimy or smelly — by then it may already be too late. (Here are the 10 dirtiest foods you’re eating.) That’s because deli meat can carry Listeria, a type of bacteria that grows even in cold temperatures and can cause fever, muscle aches, diarrhea, and serious complications for pregnant women.\n\nLike deli meat, soft cheeses such as brie and queso fresco may contain Listeria, as well as E. coli — especially if they’re made with unpasteurized milk. And compared to harder cheeses, spoiled portions are harder to fully trim away. As a general rule, you should consume them by the use-by date, or within five to seven days of purchasing, says Nwadike.\n\nSprouts can be sketchy, regardless of whether they’re consumed by the date on the packaging. That’s because they’re grown in warm, moist conditions that are prone to contamination and ideal for the growth of bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella. (Here’s how your food gets contaminated.) So if you’re immune-compromised (i.e., pregnant, very young, old or sick), you should steer clear, says Nwadike. And if you’re not, try to source your sprouts from someone reputable when possible or grow your own, and absolutely do not eat them past the use-by date.\n\nThis goes for premade salads, bagged, and loose leafy greens. Even though many of these are prewashed multiple times, studies have shown that they still have a tendency to carry bacteria like E. coli, as they’re handled so frequently, says Levy. Always wash these prior to eating, and don’t eat past the date, or once they begin to get slimy — whichever comes first.\n\nPhoto: ShutterstockMuch of the fresh raw meat sold in stores is contaminated with Salmonella, E. coli and other bacteria that can cause foodborne illnesses, and should be consumed or frozen by the use-by date — before bacteria has a chance to greatly multiply. But even before the date, you need to be careful by making sure you cook your meat to the appropriate temperature (check out safe minimum cooking temperatures for all meats here). The greatest risk is posed by ground beef, says Levy, as it’s handled more during processing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eat Clean.",

That's it over there, sort of hunkered down in the shelter of those big gray buildings with the big old trees all around it.\n\nYou've probably seen it on television when the boss comes out the back door to get on his helicopter and does that graceful walk where he looks backward and waves and smiles all the time he's walking forward to get on the helicopter. The foremen work in there, too. The boss has three of them. Ed and Bob and Mike.\n\nYou've probably seen Ed on TV. Ed Meese, that is. A sweet guy. Big blond fellow with a nice little smile, but don't let that smile fool you. Ed's got his eye on everything happens on this ranch.\n\nLike the old mill up there on the hill. See it there? The place with the antique dome. That didn't used to go with the ranch until the boss took over here. It's got two big rooms they call the Senate and the House, but what with the way the boss has been consolidating things on the ranch since he got here I wouldn't be surprised to see him change the names before long.\n\nSome folks say he ought to call them Studio One and Studio Two. Of course he got the Senate lock, stock and barrel when he took over the big house, but it took him a while to get possession of the House. You hear that bellowing? Sounds scary, doesn't it, but there's nothing to be worried about any more.\n\nThat's just old Tip. The boss has got him caged up now, but it took a piece of doing. Old Tip bellowed and snorted and roared all over up there like he was going to gore the liver and lights out of the boss if he tried to lay hands on the property.\n\nSince the boss fixed him, though, he ain't nothing but hot air. All the boss had to do was to have a bunch of the hands down to the big house and massage them real good. You know. A little carrot to make them smile and then a whack on the rump to make them see the light of reason.\n\n''You fellows like them good fat pay envelopes every Friday night up there at the mill?'' he asked them, or something like that. ''Well, if you want to keep collecting, you'd better help me get the rope around old Tip and put the ring in his nose, or I'm going to see you all kicked out of there and looking for work come November a year from now.''\n\nThey saw the light of reason. Now we can rename the whole place Warner Brothers if we want to, that's how tight we got it locked up. Speaking of locked up, see that big shed way out on the east forty there? Looks like some blow-the-bankroll New Dealer bought a Greek temple and had it moved onto the ranch at taxpayer's expense? Well, that didn't used to go with the ranch either.\n\nSupreme Court, they called it in these parts. Still do, though I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't change the name there, too. Call it The Screen-ing Room, maybe. It pretty much be-longs to the boss already, but he's going to get full title to it in a few weeks.\n\nNothing in there but nine old men and the boss has the rights to replace them as they drop off. He'll be replacing one any day now. It's going to make the ranch a lot tidier than it's been for fifty years or so, what with the old men and the hands at the mill all seeing eye to eye on where to put the barbed wire and which steers to ship to market.\n\nNow down there in the low ground -right marshy down there - you got the big corrals and the bunkhouses. That's where the boss keeps the gunslingers and the slick talkers. The gunslingers' job is to make war and the slick talkers are supposed to come up with a foreign policy that will make sure the wars don't get too big to handle.\n\nSince the boss took over, the gunslingers have been working night and day to figure ways to make the wars bigger and better, and the slick talkers have been flying around the world and talking up a storm.\n\nThe boss is going to get the slick talkers all up to the big house one of these days and invent a foreign policy to help hold the wars down. All they need is a little pep talk from the boss. You know the kind of thing: ''I want you slick talkers to get out there and hold one down for the Gipper.''\n\nOnce we get the ranch all consolidated and fenced in, the boss will get around to that. Speaking of fenced in, that barbed wire enclosure over there is where they make the Democrats stand baying and bawling while Dave Stockman soaks the poor.\n\nYou must have heard of Dave, the best poor soaker to come down the line in a month of Sundays. Watching him work drives old Tip absolutely wild. Really makes you feel good to hear old Tip bellowing harmlessly every time Dave dips one for a good soaking.\n\nYes sir, the boss has finally got this place organized and working. In less than six months he's made it all his. Every inch of it. Studio One, Studio Two, Screening Room, corrals, bunkhouses and soaker. There's nothing can stop him from doing whatever he wants to.\n\nIn fact, he's got all the tools a boss needs except for one. He's got nobody left to blame it on if everything goes bad.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, July 23— Murray Gart, editor of The Washington Star, poked his head into a political columnist's office this morning. ''Sorry,'' said Mr. Gart quietly. ''We're not very happy, Murray,'' replied the columnist, Jack Germond. ''That's what I hear,'' said Mr. Gart, who suggested that the two men have a chat ''when you're ready.'' Mr. Gart disappeared and Mr. Germond, turning back to his desk, observed cheerlessly, ''I don't think I'm ever going to be ready.'' And so it went at The Star today, as staff members reacted sadly, bitterly, angrily to the news that Time Inc. will close the 128-yearold newspaper.\n\nFor 10 years, employees of the financially troubled Star have been haunted by rumors of the paper's demise. They have seen three owners and a succession of editors come and go. To ease the financial pinch, they once agreed to work five days for four days' pay.\n\nYet today they were stunned. ''Did you ever think you'd see this day?'' Mary McGrory, the syndicated columnist, asked as she paced in front of the newsroom coffee pot.\n\nMiss McGrory, who rose from assistant book reviewer in 1947 to Pulitzer Prize winner, has for years been a sort of mother confessor to young reporters, but today, even she seemed overwhelmed.''I'm angry at the way they handled this,'' she said, referring to Time Inc. ''Angry at the town for not supporting us.''\n\nA few steps away, William F. McIlwain, executive managing editor, was on the telephone in his office, describing the ''exceptional people here.''\n\n''That was The Wall Street Journal,'' Mr. McIlwain said, hanging up. ''That could be a good place for some of our people.'' As he spoke, George Beveridge, associate editor, hurried in. ''I think we should go ahead with the party,'' said Mr. Beveridge, grimfaced, referring to a going-away party for Mr. McIlwain, recently named editor of The Arkansas Gazette.\n\n''Sure, why not?'' said Mr. McIlwain. ''Even if the champagne hasn't arrived by then, we'll do it,'' said Mr. Beveridge, hurrying out again.\n\nLate in the afternoon, Murray Gart, wearing a Washington Star necktie, navy with red stars, told the group assembled in the newsroom that he had done everything in his power to keep the paper alive. ''You are all great people, individually and collectively,'' he said. ''I can't tell you how sorry I am this has happened. Maybe a miracle will happen before Aug. 7.''\n\nMr. Gart, a longtime Time Inc. employee, was the subject of heated discussion, not all of it complimentary. Boris Weintraub, a feature writer in the Washington Life section, has been at the Star for 17 years. As he ate his lunch off a plastic tray at his desk, he said of Time: ''They never understood that this was a special place - the camaraderie, the esprit. They came in here and their attitude was always an insulting one.''\n\nBut others blamed problems in advertising, production and distribution. ''It's not him at all,'' said Eric Seidman, the designs director, of Mr. Gart. Mr. Seidman, whose redesign of The Star has won top awards, added: ''He has taken this paper and made it a paper of the first caliber. So what's left? The financial side, and that's where you have heavy, heavy problems.''\n\nSidney Epstein, associate publisher, first telephoned department heads at their homes at 7 A.M. today. ''It's not good news,'' said Mr. Epstein, summoning them to an 8 A.M. meeting at which they were shown the press release announcing the closing.\n\nOther Star employees learned the news on the radio, from friends or editors, and in some cases, when they arrived at work. Many spent much of the day telephoning for job interviews.\n\nAt the bulletin board next to Miss McGrory's office a steady stream of reporters filed past to look at hiring notices from other newspapers. The conversation went like this:\n\n''I just got a nibble from The Hartford Courant,'' ... ''So what are you going to do?'' ... ''Early retirement maybe.'' ... ''Somehow, I can't bring myself to think about Detroit.'' ... ''You mean you would rather go to Dallas?'' ... ''Yeah, at least they've got some money.''\n\nAt about 3 P.M., men began wheeling into the news room cases of champagne, trays of cold cuts and cake for the McIlwain farewell party. By 3:30, corks were popping.\n\nSomeone posted a note from Katharine Graham, chairman of the board of the Washington Post Company. ''Dear Murray,'' began the note, handwritten on pale blue paper. ''My heart is broken for you.''\n\nMany who read the note responded with unprintable epithets. And Morris Siegel, The Star's veteran sports columnist, suggested in a bit of gallows humor, ''We finally beat the hell out of The Post on a story.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of the Washington Star's newsroom",

        "instruction": "BOSTON, Nov. 24— On the wind-blown gray expanse of an asphalt parking lot here, two Postal Service tractor trailers are parked and locked. Filled with unread mail, they stand in mute testimony to what has evolved as the Reagan Administration's blockade of Cuban periodicals.\n\nThe outside of the trailers glinted with ice this morning. Inside, a colony of unidentified bugs toiled away at the plain manila envelopes containing such magazines and newspapers as Bohemia, Primsa, Boletin de la Comision Nacional Cubana de la Unesco and Granma, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba.\n\nThe envelopes are marked for delivery to subscribers all over the United States. But they have been piling up here since May, their delivery blocked by an Administration order promulgated under the Trading With the Enemies Act of 1917. To receive delivery, a subscriber must obtain a license from the Foreign Assets Control section of the Treasury Department.\n\nLast week, because the ''paper fleas,'' as United States Customs officials here call them, and the sheer bulk of the mail bags were creating a problem in the main postal facility in Boston, the bags were transferred to the trailers. Today, across town, a coalition of lawyers representing a long list of American publications, university professors and private citizens, filed a suit in Federal District Court attacking the blockade as a violation of First Amendment rights. 'A Complete Departure'\n\n''They are saying that the average American needs a license to read whatever he wants to read,'' said Michael Avery, a Boston lawyer associated with the National Lawyers Guild. ''This is a complete departure from the view of the First Amendment that this country has always had.''\n\nThe decision to file the suit was made after negotiations with the Administration broke down, according to Michael Ratner, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City. ''We spent two months trying to negotiate this with the State Department and Treasury,'' he said. ''The Treasury agreed to change the regulations to allow the unlicensed importation of publications of Cuban origin, but the State Department pulled the rug out from under them.''\n\nRobert Don Levine, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, said today that he could not confirm Mr. Ratner's account of the negotiations, but he indicated that the matter was not considered closed. ''Proposals are still being debated inside the Government,'' he said.\n\nThe Trading With the Enemies Act has existed since World War I, and the economic blockade of Cuba since the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis in 1963. But, plaintifs and defendants agree, this is the first time that any administration has invoked the formal ''state of emergency'' powers to block the flow of printed information.\n\nAnd by Mr. Levine's account, and that of Customs officials here, this policy began entirely by happenstance. To Boston Via Montreal\n\n''It's the first time, I think,'' Mr. Levine said, ''but it's a question of being the first time the Cuban publications have come to anyone's attention.''\n\nForeign mail and parcels enter the United States only through certain post offices with Customs facilities in them. Because of the impaired state of American relations with Cuba, the bulk of Cuban periodicals have been flown from Havana to Montreal, in Canada, and thus down to Boston.\n\n''I think this was the routing on it,'' said Gordon Vancor, an assistant district director of Customs here. ''For a long time, it was being re-bagged in Montreal, and coming in in Canadian bags. And it apparently was getting through. Then, for some reason, it was left in Cuban bags, and suddenly we were getting inundated with Cuban mail. And we checked with Foreign Assets Control in Washington and there you have it - they told us to detain it.''\n\nThe purpose of the economic blockade initiated almost 20 years ago, Mr. Ratner said, was to deprive Cuba of foreign exchange. Although no one knows for sure, and although there are almost a million Cuban-Americans now estimated to be living in this country, there seem to be only a few thousand subscribers to Cuban periodicals. 'Political Hardball'\n\n''There was no reason for them to block these periodicals except to play a sort of political hardball with Cuba,'' Mr. Ratner said. The plaintifs, led by The Nation magazine, are suing a list of defendants led by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Donald Regan, the Secetary of the Treasury.\n\nThe Federal Government has 60 days to respond; in the meantime, any subscribers who want their backlogged magazines delivered must write a letter to Foreign Assets Control in Washington asking for a license, and then send a copy of the license on to Customs officials here.\n\nMichael Cunningham, the supervisor of the six-member Customs office in the postal building here, said that he has received about 35 licenses from people who want their mail.\n\nRetrieving that mail is another question, however. Mr. Cunningham gazed into the dim interior of the two trailers yesterday, and had a thought. ''This is going to start posing a problem,'' he said.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Michael Cunningham",

Smith Jr., who signed on last October as p resident and chief executive officer of the strugg ling Pabst Brewing Company here.\n\nMr. Smith, who is Pabst's fourth chief executive in 13 months, is locked in a couple of battles, and losing either would most likely spell the end of his career at Pabst. One problem is inside: The company has been selling less and less beer; its revenues for last year were down; it is expected to report a loss for the year, and its position in the industry, third in 1980, has tumbled to fifth.\n\nThe other battle is outside. It involves Irwin L. Jacobs, a financier from Minneapolis who says he and six associates own 14 percent of Pabst's stock and are trying to take control of the company. Mr. Jacobs has unnerved Mr. Smith to the point that last week, Pabst brought suit against Mr. Jacobs and his associates to halt further purchases of Pabst stock and to stop what was called ''securities law violations.''\n\nThrough the thermopane windows, which fortify the refurbished Pabst bottling house against Wisconsin's bone-chilling West winds, Mr. Smith can see the familiar Schlitz logo on the side of a shuttered brewery to the north. The crosstown competitor's plant was closed last June, a casualty of the same intense beer wars that have been so harsh on Pabst. The industry leaders, Anheuser-Busch Inc. and the Miller Brewing Company, keep growing, at the expense of most other brewers.\n\nBut if there was one executive who seemed to have the mettle to rehabilitate Pabst, it was the 46-year-old Mr. Smith. A towering 6-foot 4-inch man weighing 210 pounds, he was recruited from the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the maker of Iron City Beer, where he had engineered the turnaround in circumstances similar to Pabst 's. He is known as an aggressive executive with a stron g sense of urgency, and he thinks his predecessors at Pabst did not d emonstrate enough of either trait.\n\n''We're at a critical situation at our company,'' he said as he poured himself a Pabst Blue Ribbon and lighted a long cigar. ''Our short-term strategy is survival. Longer term, we'll perpetuate our future.\n\n''But we are working against time,'' he added. ''There are external forces at work and it's my job to point the way back. If I wasn't able to do that, I wouldn't be here. I came after this job.''\n\nPabst will report a substantial year-end loss later this month, reflecting a decline in shipments from more than 15 million barrels of beer in 1980 to less than 14 million barrels in 1981. At the end of the third quarter, its red ink totaled $2.5 million, or 30 cents a share, despite a $3.4 million tax credit in the first half of the year. For the third quarter alone, the company had a loss of $3.9 million, or 47 cents a share. The performance is a far cry from last year when through the third quarter it had profits of $10.4 million.\n\nSales during the first nine months of 1981 fell to $643.6 million, from $671.9 million a year earlier. The ''external forces'' that Mr. Smith cites include Mr. Jacobs, who ranks as the company's largest stockholder. Mr. Jacobs, angered by the company's poor performance and by what he views as apathy on the part of directors, has threatened a proxy fight to gain control at the annual shareholders meeting in April.\n\nPabst management suspects that Mr. Jacobs intends to take over the company and then liquidate it. And he has done as much before. In 1975, after taking over Grain Belt Breweries Inc. of Minneapolis, Mr. Jacobs attempted to run the company for 10 months, reportedly losing about $200,000 a month. He ended by selling the rights to the company's labels to the G. Heileman Brewing Company for nearly $4 million, and Grain Belt's assets for another $4 million.\n\nBut Mr. Jacobs says he has no such plans for Pabst. He plans to run the company. ''There's not a night I go to bed that I don't wake up thinking about Pabst,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''That is the absolute fact. As bad as it looks to everyone else, that's how good it looks to me. I'm excited and I want to get going.''\n\nMr. Smith, however, is indisposed to let him try. He said he owed his allegiance to the board that hired him. ''I intend to fight very strongly for the Pabst Brewing Company. The problem is,'' Mr. Smith said of the battle with Mr. Jacobs, ''he's taking a lot of my time. I just wish I could get down to the job of selling beer.''\n\nIt's easy to see what is driving the dissident Mr. Jacobs, who was a member of Pabst's board for a brief time last summer. His investment in the company cost $20 million, and he has been watching its value erode as Pabst's losses have mounted. Its stock, which is currently selling for around $12 a share, was as high as $18 early last year.\n\nWhile Pabst's sales decline is pushing it down two notches in the industry standings, Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, the industry leader, remains strong, gaining market share. It sold about 54.5 million barrels in 1981, nearly one of every three barrels sold in the United States last year. Miller Brew ing, a subsidiary of Philip Morris Inc., reported an 8.1 percent s ales increase, to 40.3 million barrels, and the Jos. Schlitz Brewi ng Company will apparently regain third position, even though its be er sales fell 4 percent from almost 15 million barrels in 1980 to 14 .3 million last year.\n\nHeileman, based in La Crosse, Wis., apparently is expected to rise to fourth place from the sixth position on the basis of an increase to nearly 14 million barrels from 13.3 million barrels in 1980.\n\nMr. Smith, who won the top job at Pabst partly because he talked Pittsburgh strikers back to work after a 17-day strike in 1978, sees his primary responsibility as a return to the black.",

Smith Jr., who signed on last October as p resident and chief executive officer of the strugg ling Pabst Brewing Company here.   Mr. Smith, who is Pabst's fourth chief executive in 13 months, is locked in a couple of battles, and losing either would most likely spell the end of his career at Pabst. One problem is inside: The company has been selling less and less beer; its revenues for last year were down; it is expected to report a loss for the year, and its position in the industry, third in 1980, has tumbled to fifth.   The other battle is outside. It involves Irwin L. Jacobs, a financier from Minneapolis who says he and six associates own 14 percent of Pabst's stock and are trying to take control of the company. Mr. Jacobs has unnerved Mr. Smith to the point that last week, Pabst brought suit against Mr. Jacobs and his associates to halt further purchases of Pabst stock and to stop what was called ''securities law violations.''"

        "instruction": "BY now, the enormous development of money market funds since they first came into wide-scale public acceptance during the last decade has become familiar to investors and noninvestors alike. But relatively few are aware of what has recently become the most rapidly growing portion of this industry: tax-free money market funds that invest in short-term debt of state and local governments.\n\nThe tax-exempt funds, which are of increasing benefit to investors as their tax bracket rises to the maximum Federal income tax rate of 50 percent, are by no means a new invention. But in the last year or so, the assets of these funds - which have all the advantages and the disadvantages of money market funds in general - have proliferated.\n\nThe chief advantages, of course, are liquidity through checkwriting and other means, which makes the funds stiff competition for checking accounts, and relative safety of principal.\n\nTotal assets of the 27 tax-free funds were $7.4 billion at the end of March, up from $3 billion held by 21 funds a year earlier, according to Lipper Analytical Services. By contrast, assets of all money market funds rose at a much slower rate, to $198.2 billion from $114.9 billion in this period.\n\n''It's the fastest-growing segment, and it makes sense,'' said Michael Lipper, president of the service, which tracks money market funds. As of the end of last month, Lipper statistics showed that the 30-day average yield of the tax-exempt funds was 8.04 percent, compared with 13.92 percent for the taxable money market funds.\n\n''The rates of return in recent months have been quite attractive to people in the 50 percent bracket,'' said Alfred Johnson, chief economist of the Investment Company Institute, the trade association for the sponsors of mutual funds, including money market funds. The tax-exempt variety, he added, ''is going to be part of our stable of funds for the foreseeable future.''\n\nOn the supply side, state and local governments have stepped up their use of short-term notes to meet their requirements, issuing about $30 billion worth last year.\n\n''Over the last six months or so, many local governments have been forced to turn to short-term securities as long-term rates have shot up,'' said Jeffrey Esser, director of the Federal liaison center of the Municipal Finance Officers Association. ''Without question, they are a very important factor, and they are growing exponentially.''\n\nWhat is more, the Municipal Bond Insurance Association, which insures certain municipals and thereby raises their Standard & Poor's ratings to AAA, started guranteeing the principal and interest of short-term obligations nine months ago. ''We think it's a good growth area, but no one can predict how long it will last,'' said John R. Butler, president of the association, which has already insured about a half-billion dollars' worth of short-term municipal notes.\n\nNaturally, fund managers are more optimistic. ''As long as municipalities develop these products, we'll see rapid growth in taxfree money funds,'' said Denis Jamison, vice president of the Lexington Management Corporation, which sponsors the Lexington Tax-Free Daily Income Fund. ''Unless somebody wants to aggressively manage his own portfolio, the short-term market is a difficult one for an individual investor,'' said Peter Gordon, executive vice president of the T. Rowe Price Tax-Exempt Money Fund.\n\nThe tax-exempt money market funds, which are generally priced at a net asset value of $1 a share, have certain restrictions placed on them by the Securities and Exchange Commission. For example, the maximum maturity of securities in their portfolios is one year, while the average maturity cannot exceed 120 days. The stability of the net asset value allows the price of the shares to remain fixed, while the interest rate can fluctuate.\n\nThe average maturities of the tax-free funds are significantly longer than the taxable funds. Mr. Lipper estimates that tax-exempt money market funds have an average maturity of 70 days, more than twice the 30-day average maturity of the taxable kind.\n\nLonger maturities, of course, are a decided disadvantage if interest rates rise. Another disadvantage of tax-exempt funds is the lack of as many high-quality short-term securities to choose from as there are in the taxable markets. And it is more difficult for managers to ''ladder'' a tax-exempt portfolio, or purchase securities in such a way that some of them mature every day, rather than, say, twice a month.\n\nIan MacKinnon, vice president of the Vanguard Group, which manages the Vanguard Municipal Bond Fund, believes that buyers pay for the stability of net asset value by accepting lower interest rates than they would get from long-term obligations of comparable quality. ''Usually, there is a trade-off between income and stability of principal,'' he said.\n\nDespite these pitfalls, expectations in the trade are for continued expansion of tax-exempt money market funds. ''The word is just getting out,'' said Ray Goodner, portfolio manager of the I.D.S. Tax-Free Money Fund.",

        "instruction": "NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 28— Five African nations formally agreed today to the the deployment of peacekeeping troops in Chad by Dec. 17, the first such force assembled by the Organization of African Unity.\n\nPresident Goukouni Oueddei of Chad met into the early hours today with Kenya's President, Daniel arap Moi, and officials from four of the six African nations that have pledged to contribute troops to the force. The O.A.U. soldiers will replace Libyan troops that have withdrawn.\n\nAlthough the African officials agreed on the Dec. 17 date for the arrival of the peacekeeping units in Chad, they left unanswered the question of the force's precise mandate.\n\nAccording to an African diplomat who declined to be identified, Mr. Goukouni wanted the force to attack rebels in the east of the country, but most of the contributing nations wanted their troops to avoid combat and act as a buffer between contesting factions. A Troubled Independence\n\nChad, in northwest Africa, has been engulfed in fighting for most of its two decades of independence from France. Last December, President Goukouni invited Libya to send troops to halt the warfare. He asked them to leave last month, and they did so precipitously, prompting a renewal of fighting in the east between Government forces and troops loyal to former Defense Minister Hissen Habre.\n\nAt a news conference after the weekend meeting, Mr. Goukouni said he was not optimistic about his country's future ''as long as the peacekeeping force has not arrived in Chad.''\n\nSo far only about 700 Zairian paratroopers and 150 Senegalese soldiers are said to have arrived in Ndjamena, Chad's capital. The other nations that initially pledged to contribute troops to the peacekeeping force are Nigeria, Guinea, Benin and Togo. Gabon has offered logistical support. 'Appeal to Friendly Forces'\n\nMr. Goukouni said his army, a fledgling force made up of fighters from some of Chad's 11 political factions, was not capable of defending the country against ''unruly elements.''\n\n''If our young army is not able to maintain order, and the Organization of African Unity hesitates, the Chad Government has the right to appeal to friendly forces to come in and put down a rebellion,'' he said.\n\nIn such a case, he added, the O.A.U. ''would not be able to open its mouth since it could not keep peace in the country.'' Asked if by ''friendly forces'' he meant France, which has promised to finance the African force, or Libya, Mr. Goukouni said: ''Why not Libya? We are not enemies. We are friends.'' An Appeal to Chad's Neighbors\n\nEarlier, Kenya and four of the six African nations pledging troops - Zaire, Nigeria, Benin and Togo -issued a communique calling on Chad's neighbors ''to grant no form of direct or indirect assistance to dissident elements in Chad.'' The two other nations pledging troops, Guinea and Senegal, did not attend the meeting.\n\nThe communique noted that Mr. Goukouni's Government ''is recognized by the Organization of African Unity as the legitimate Government of Chad.''\n\nThe O.A.U., which has not assembled a peacekeeping force before, is facing many challenges as well as a test of credibility over its intervention in Chad.\n\nMilitarily, the force will have to dislodge Mr. Habre's rebels from the east if it is to establish control throughout the country. Reports from Chad have indicated that the rebels have seized the country's fourth largest city, Abeche, a strategic settlement that controls ground access to the east as well as the only airfield in the area. Mandate Is Unclear\n\nMr. Goukouni said today that the force's mandate had ''not been specified,'' raising a question as to whether the African troops, which are to be under the command of Nigeria, the largest contributor, would fight Mr. Habre's rebels to regain control of the east.\n\nA second major issue is the involvement of outside forces, some of them allies of the United States. African diplomats who declined to be identified said that today's communique was directed largely at the Sudan, which is Mr. Habre's main backer. However, Libya and neighboring Cameroon are also interested in how Chad's lingering crisis unfolds. None of these three nations were represented at the meeting.\n\nLibya has demonstrated its ability to direct the course of events in Chad, first by its intervention and second by the speed of its withdrawal.\n\nThe Sudan, an American ally, did not restrain Mr. Habre's forces from occupying four eastern Chadian towns when the Libyans withdrew from the area last month. According to Western intelligence sources who declined to be identified, Egyptian arms are being funneled through the Sudan to Mr. Habre's units. A senior Libyan official in Chad said recently that Mr. Habre also had arms cached in Cameroon. O.A.U. Credibility at Stake\n\nA further issue is the political cohesiveness and coordination of the African force. Zaire dispatched its troops unilaterally, apparently jumping the gun. Guinea reportedly sent word to Nairobi that its leaders were ''too busy'' to attend the meeting and that it was no longer certain that it would contribute troops.\n\nAlthough the Nairobi meeting was initially advertised as a gathering of heads of state, only the Presidents of Kenya and Chad attended. Zaire, Nigeria, Benin and Togo were represented by highranking Cabinet officers.\n\nWhen he opened the meeting Friday, the Kenyan President, who is the current chairman of the O.A.U., said the group's ''credibility has been at stake'' over the formation of the Chad force.\n\nLast year, an earlier attempt to establish an African force for Chad collapsed when Congolese troops abandoned their positions in heavy fighting for the capital.\n\nMr. Goukouni's comments today seemed to indicate that he was holding open the door to a reconciliation with the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who wants to merge the two nations. Mr. Goukouni has resisted the Libyan's overtures in the past, but aides say he was taken aback by the speed of Libya's withdrawal and the resultant troubles in the east.\n\nIllustrations: photo of President Goukouni Queddel",

        "instruction": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.— In the past two weeks, Americans followed with dismay the latest chapter in the plight of Andrei D. Sakharov and his wife, Yelena G. Bonner, the Russian dissidents who were conducting a hunger strike to protest Soviet authorities' refusal to allow their daughter-in-law to emigrate. In this country, persecution of Soviet dissidents frequently becomes front-page news. The Gulag Archipelago, the Soviet system of forced labor camps has become synonymous with the moral horrors of totalitarianism. Dissidents such as the Sakharovs, Alexandr Solzhenitsyn or Anatoly Shcharansky have at various times become practically household names and American groups often agitate on their behalf, sometimes with successful results.\n\nThere has been no similar reaction to the widespread political persecution of intellectuals in China. Probably no more than a handful of Americans know the name of Lao She, one of China's most popular writers, who was drowned in the late 1960's by Red Guards in a Peking lake. He was the author of a poignant novel, ''Rickshaw Boy,'' about the tragic life of a rickshaw puller in pre-1949 China. There have been no outcries about recent attacks in the Chinese press on a prominent writer, Bai Hua, who wrote a movie that questions how successful the Communists have been. Bai Hua has been forced to make a self-criticism and his fate is unclear.\n\nHave Americans had a double standard when it comes to the Soviet Union's and China's treatment of dissidents? Merle Goldman, a professor of history at Boston University and author of a new book, ''China's Intellectuals: Advise and Dissent,'' believes the answer is a culpable yes. Other China specialists argue that Americans' different attitudes toward Moscow and Peking are based on slowness in understanding China or on Chinese Communists' less brutal methods of control.\n\nJohn K. Fairbank, professor emeritus of Chinese history at Harvard, said he does not believe there is a double standard because ''there are real differences in style between the Russians and the Chinese, even if the Chinese still have their security police and labor camps.'' The Chinese have made a ''public confession'' about the atrocities of the Cultural Revolution, unlike anything in Russia, and have made a greater effort to correct past abuses than the Soviet Union.\n\nBut Mrs. Goldman, in an article in the current issue of the Radcliffe Quarterly, charges that ''like those who knew about the Holocaust, my colleagues and I in the China field did not speak out loudly and publicly about the persecution of intellectuals'' in the anti-rightist campaign of 1957 and the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960's. ''A whole generation of westernized intellectuals were decimated,'' she observes - professors, scientists, doctors, lawyers, artists, writers and architects. ''The institutions they helped to create - the universities, research institutes, journals, libraries and other creative enterprises, were also decimated,'' she said. Ignoring Grim Facts\n\nThere are no overall government figures on the number of Chinese intellectuals persecuted since the Communist triumph in 1949, but there are some indications. A knowledgeable Chinese editor told Mrs. Goldman, who is also an associate of the Center for East Asian Research at Harvard, that between 400,000 and 700,000 intellectuals were arrested, imprisoned or sent to work in the countryside during the anti-rightist movement alone in 1957-58. Only in 1978, two years after the death of Mao Zedong, were the last group of these people, 110,000, released from prison or labor reform camps, according to a Chinese Communist Party document.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 engulfed an even larger number of people, including party officials, army officers and factory managers as well as intellectuals. The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, once reported that 100 million people were affected by the Cultural Revolution. In a speech in 1979, Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, disclosed that 2.9 million people purged or imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution had since been rehabilitated.\n\nBy comparison, in the Soviet Union today there are perhaps 10,000 or at most several tens of thousands of political prisoners being held in the Gulag Archipelago, aside from ordinary criminals. That is the estimate of Joshua Rubinstein, the New England coordinator for Amnesty International and author of ''Soviet Dissidents, The Struggle for Human Rights,'' a book published last year.\n\nPolitical persecution in China reached such proportions, Mrs. Goldman writes, that Chinese who have survived ''describe their experience as comparable to the Holocaust.''\n\nThat analogy, she said, is not entirely correct. ''Millions of people were not killed systematically. Though Mao and his supporters set the anti-intellectual tone,'' she observed, ''the persecution of the intellectuals was due more to the chaotic nature of the time than to an organized government policy.''\n\nBut, Mrs. Goldman added, ''the situations were comparable'' in at least one respect because, like the Jews in the Second World War, ''the intellectuals were persecuted primarily for what they were, rather than for what they did.'' Reasons and Illusions\n\n''Where were the Western China scholars when this calamity befell our intellectual colleagues in China?'' Mrs. Goldman asks. ''We can't plead ignorance; the Chinese newspapers were filled day after day with pictures of intellectuals being paraded through the streets in dunce caps. As in the Holocaust, we knew but we didn't want to believe. It was too horrible.''\n\nMrs. Goldman offers several reasons for Americans' greater severity toward the Soviet Union. For one thing, she noted, it is frequently said that ''those who study the Soviet Union hate it, while those who study China love it.'' ''We scholars of China are enamored of its history, culture and people,'' she said. ''We didn't want to believe that a country that had developed such a high level of civilization could be so cruel to its intellectuals.''\n\nIn addition, Mrs. Goldman contends, many Americans wanted to believe that Mao and the Communists ''really had the answer to China's problems after so many years of chaos, famine and weakness.'' In particular, some Americans on the far left, dissillusioned by the Vietnam War and Watergate, looked on Mao's calls for revolution and egalitarianism as a model for the United States, she said.\n\nFor those wanting to study in China itself, there may have been practical considerations as well. As the United States moved toward normalization of relations with Peking in 1979 and as it appeared possible that China scholars would be able to see the country ''from which they had been barred since 1949,'' Mrs. Goldman noted, ''most did not want to jeopardize their chance to get a visa.''\n\nMichel C. Oksenberg, a professor at the University of Michigan and a member of the National Security Council under President Carter, says he is troubled that Americans may have a double standard toward Moscow and Peking but he believes it is really a matter of American lateness in comprehending China.\n\nThe United States did not have diplomats, journalists or scholars in China during the Cultural Revolution, he pointed out, and it is only recently, after the normalization of relations, ''that we are getting a fine-grained feel of China.''\n\nIn historical terms, Mr. Oksenberg added, the Cultural Revolution was more like Stalin's vast purges in the 1930's when Americans who did not understand the Soviet Union well were not as vociferous as they are now about human rights in Russia.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Chinese criminals being displayed during Culteral Revolution photo of Andrei Sakharov and Yelena Bonner in Gorky",

Turning to an app for help might not seem like an obvious course, but many apps do provide worthwhile support.\n\nGracie Barra Brazilian Jiu jitsu\n\n$45 for series of apps on iOS\n\nBrazilian jujitsu (right), which largely focuses on ground fighting, is quickly gaining in popularity, and one of the most popular styles, the Gracie Barra Brazilian Jiu jitsu, has some particularly strong apps.\n\nThey include videos that document techniques like defenses and escapes. Each video is performed by experts and filmed from different angles so you can see exactly what’s going on. There’s also narration about the moves, and the video pauses at key points. These videos supplement what you learn in person, and they are part of a 16-week course that gets progressively more complex.\n\nAs teaching supplements, the apps will certainly help you brush up on techniques, but apart from the videos there’s not much content. The apps are also expensive. One on iOS costs $15 for the first four weeks, and the remaining three apps are $10 each.\n\n$4 on iOS and Android\n\nA great alternative jujitsu app is iBJJ.\n\nInstead of video, iBJJ relies on still photos that you can scan through in the style of a flip book. The app makers say this is to help you see the techniques at your own pace, instead of at the forced pace of a video. The photos have descriptive text, and there’s an option to see frames from a reverse angle to better illustrate the way the body should be positioned.\n\nThe iBJJ app is easy to navigate, with techniques broken down into categories like “top guard” or “back attacking.”\n\nThe flip-book teaching style may suit beginners while serving as an encyclopedia of moves for experienced practitioners. And the app has plenty of content.\n\nFree on iOS and Android\n\nKarate practitioners may appreciate the app Learn Karate by Fitivity. This app (on Android it’s called Karate Training) could be a useful practice resource. In addition to lessons on karate techniques, it has sections on how to keep flexible and build strength.\n\nIt also has a section for the many katas, or symbolic attack and defense postures, that practitioners must learn.\n\nThe lessons include videos as well as still photos and descriptions of how to move.\n\nOverall, it’s a nicely designed app with a professional feel that tries to please beginner and expert karateka alike. Though the basic app is free, higher levels require an in-app payment of $5.\n\nTaekwondo is another popular martial art, with Korean origins. Unlike many of its rivals, Taekwondo Bible has been frequently updated, which means that it may run better on your device.\n\nThis app contains detailed instructions about how to practice the patterns, including diagrams that show how to place one’s feet — and it even includes explanations of what the Korean names of the moves mean.\n\nIt’s straightforward in design, and it looks good — a nice contrast to many Android apps.\n\nHowever, while the first five taekwondo patterns in the app are free, you have to pay for the full list.\n\nOn iOS there are surprisingly few good taekwondo apps, but Taekwondo White Belt has been recently updated, a nice sign that its developers are paying attention.\n\nTaekwondo White Belt is aimed at beginners, and it describes some of the martial art’s history and philosophy. It also has detailed instructions that explain many techniques using photos, text, and video.\n\nIt’s easy to navigate this app, but clicking through the different sections of the app takes time, and sometimes menus feel unresponsive.\n\nAnd the full content costs $1.\n\nYang Tai Chi for Beginners\n\n$10 on iOS and Android for full content\n\nTai Chi is another martial art, though you might think of it as a slow-moving, health-based activity.\n\nYang Tai Chi for Beginners is a comprehensive app for learning one of the more popular forms of Tai Chi.

        "instruction": "The Phibro Corporation reported yesterday that a weak commodities market caused net income in the first quarter of 1982 to drop 27.9 percent, while revenues increased 4.2 percent.\n\nPhibro, a leading international commodity trading concern, said that net income in the latest three months dropped to $44 million, or 64 cents a share, from $61 million, or 89 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1982. Revenues increased to $5.96 billion from $5.72 billion.\n\nIn the latest quarter, Phibro said, the brokerage operations of Salomon Brothers continued to perform at a highly profitable level, contributing about 85 percent of consolidated pretax earnings. Salomon merged its business with Phibro on Oct. 1, 1981.\n\nThe earnings of Philipp Brothers, the Phibro unit that markets industrial raw materials throughout the world, were substantially lower than a year ago, reflecting ''the prolonged deeply recessionary condition of the world's economies which is severely affecting commodity markets,'' Phibro said.\n\nBeginning with the latest quarter, Phibro said that it would consolidate the financial results of Salomon Brothers with those of Philipp Brothers. R.J. Reynolds\n\nR.J. Reynolds Industries reported yesterday that the strengthenig of the United States dollar abroad and the weakening of oil prices worldwide were key factors in causing net income in the first quarter of 1982 to dip 1.6 percent, as revenues increased 3.6 percent.\n\nThe diversified company, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., is the world's largest producer of cigarettes, with about one-third of the market, and also has a petroleum subsidiary, Aminoil International Inc.\n\nThe company reported net income in the latest three months fell to $185 million, or $1.69 a share, from $188 million, or $1.72 a share, in the first quarter of 1981. Revenues increased to $2.87 billion from $2.77 billion in the comparable quarter last year.\n\nJ. Paul Sticht, chairman and chief executive of Reynolds, said that the effects of a strengthening United States dollar in translating results of the company's international businesses and the recent softening of pretroleum product prices worldwide were significant factors adversely affecting results for the first quarter of 1982.\n\n''First-quarter results reflected continued growth in domestic cigarette unit volume and significantly improved transportation earnings,'' Mr. Sticht said.\n\nThe company's leading cigarette brands are Winston, Salem, Camel and Vantage. Digital Equipment\n\nThe Digital Equipment Corporation reported that its earnings for its third fiscal quarter, which ended March 27, increased 7.3 percent, to $107.5 million, or $1.94 a share, from $100.2 million, or $1.89 a share, in the preceding year's third fiscal quarter. Revenues increased 18.5 percent, to $999.3 million, from $843.4 million in the comparable quarter last year.\n\nThe Maynard, Mass., computer company said that it continued to feel the pressures of the protracted worlwide business downturn, which has resulted in reduced customer demand from many of the markets it serves. Continental Group\n\nThe Continental Group announced that the general weakness in the economy caused net income in the first quarter of 1982 to plunge 41.3 percent, to $30.4 million, or 75 cents a share, from $51.8 million, or $1.39 a share, in the first quarter of 1981. Revenues dipped 7 percent, to $1.2 billion, from $1.29 billion in the first quarter of 1981.\n\n''Our forest products business suffered the greatest earnings decline,'' said Bruce Smart Jr., chairman and chief executive of the diversified company, which is based in Stamford, Conn. ''Our packaging, energy and insurance businesses had more modest decreases.'' American Can\n\nThe American Can Company said that net income in the first quarter dropped 23.9 percent, to $13.7 million, or 71 cents a share, from $18 million, or 88 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1981. Revenues dipped 4.4 percent, to $1.09 billion, from $1.14 billion in the comparable quarter last year. ---- Earnings tables, page D11.",

        "instruction": "MADRID, Tuesday, Feb. 24— A group of Civil Guards seized the lower house of Parliament yesterday and took most of the country's leaders as hostages.\n\nMembers of the Congress of Deputies were completing a vote to approve Spain's new Government when scores of Civil Guards burst in. With some of the guards firing long bursts from automatic weapons, the legislators were ordered to lie on the floor.\n\n''Shut up!'' one of the guards shouted as he pointed to his gun. ''These things work!'' At least 347 members of the Congress of Deputies and a number of senators were in the chamber. Despite the gunfire, no one was reported injured.\n\nAt about the same time, army troops with tanks briefly took control of the state-run television station outside Madrid, and the head of the Valencia military region in the east, Lieut. Gen. Jaime Milans del Bosch, proclaimed a state of emergency in his command.\n\nThe move by the general and by the leader of the plot in Madrid, Lieut. Col. Antonio Tejero Molino of the Civil Guard, both rightists apparently exasperated with terrorism and the granting of autonomy to Spain's regions, appeared aimed at igniting a national military uprising.\n\nBut early this morning there were no signs that other military units had joined the rebellion. King Juan Carlos, a military man by training and Commander in Chief of the armed forces, appeared on television after the sprawling studio complex was retaken by loyal troops. Pledges Faith in Democracy\n\nWearing full-dress uniform resplendent with medals, he denounced the seizure of Parliament and pledged his faith in democracy. ''The crown, symbol of the permanence and unity of the fatherland, cannot tolerate in any form actions or personal attitudes that aim at interruping by force the democratic process,'' he declared.\n\nHe warned all military commanders to heed orders from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had earlier issued a statement saying they had taken ''necessary measures to repress any attempt against the Constitution and to re-establish the order that it mandates.''\n\nThe seizure of the squat stone building in the heart of old Madrid occurred shortly after 6 P.M. as the members were nearing the end of a roll-call vote on the candidacy of Deputy Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo as the new Prime Minster.\n\nLed by Colonel Tejero, the green-uniformed Civil Guards armed with submachine guns entered the ornate, high-ceilinged chamber and ordered the members to raise their hands and lie on the floor. Several Civil Guards fired long bursts of automatic fire at the ceiling to silence protest; others took control of the press balcony overlooking the U-shaped chamber and ordered television and radio broadcasts of the session to cease.\n\nPrime Minister Adolfo Suarez, whose resignation last month touched off a deep political crisis, was escorted from the hall after he and a Civil Guard watching him exchanged sharp words. Mr. Suarez was being held early this morning in a room separate from the other deputies, who remained in the main chamber of the building. Other Leaders Escorted Out\n\nOther leaders to be escorted out after they had been pointed out by a rebel in civilian clothes were Deputy Prime Minister Manuel Gutierrez Mellado, himself a lieutenant general; Defense Minister Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun; Felipe Gonzalez and Alfonso Guerra, the two top leaders of the Socialist Party, and Santiago Carrillo, the Communist chief. They were also being held separately.\n\nMr. Calvo Sotelo was in the chamber but was not among those led away. ''Long live democracy!'' shouted a member of Parliament as the politicians were hustled out of the chamber. ''What for?'' answered an angry Civil Guard. ''So they can keep on killing us?'' Generals Meet in Hotel\n\nFrom the Speaker's rostrum, a Civil Guard officer read aloud a 10-point proclamation that had been issued, illegally, by General Milans del Bosch in Valencia shortly after the Parliament building was taken over.\n\nThe general's statement, which was read from Valencia radio stations apparently seized by troops, declared a curfew beginning at 9 P.M., banned all activities by political parties or groups of more than four people, and put all public services and transport under military command. The 66-year-old general also declared that he was assuming full control of the security forces and the judiciary in the area under his command ''until the corresponding instructions are received from His Majesty the King.''\n\nThe streets of Valencia, a major industrial center of 700,000, were patrolled last night by tanks loyal to the rebellious general. Policemen and Civil Guards guarded key bridges and buildings in the city.\n\nBut, by 6 A.M. this morning the rebel general was reported to be withdrawing his orders. Amid some confusion the armored vehicles were withdrawn from view.\n\nThere were reports of tanks appearing briefly on the streets of Barcelona. Meanwhile, a curious siege set in around the Parliament, where Colonel Tejero and his followers, some of them apparently reluctant recruits to his cause, had locked themselves in with the entire political leadership of the country.",

Barbaro accused him of using inflamatory words to ''set off the races.''\n\nThe Mayor, in turn, said that Mr. Barbaro favored a quota system of awarding New York City jobs. ''Now Frank believes in quotas,'' he said, adding with a little laugh: ''He just doesn't like the word.'' Mr. Koch and Mr. Barbaro, one of the Mayor's opponents in the Democratic primary on Sept. 10, sat in shirtsleeves, occasionally glowering at each other across the third candidate, Melvin Klenetsky, who was a taut barrier between them in a dark blue suit. From Jokes to Gibes\n\nThe radio debate on station WKCR, in a cramped and stuffy studio on the Columbia University campus, began with heavy jocularity but turned testy when Mr. Barbaro accused the Mayor of worsening racial tensions.\n\n''I'm not a doctor and I don't have a bedside manner,'' Mr. Koch said, when asked about the Citizens Union comment in its endorsement of him that his outspoken manner could be polarizing.\n\n''It's my nature,'' Mr. Koch said, ''and I'll try to curb it.'' Mr. Barbaro persisted. ''There you go again, Eddie,'' he said after Mr. Koch had accused him of planning to use quotas - by sex, race and so forth - to staff the city government. ''You set off the magic words.''\n\nIn the final minute of the one-hour presentation, Mr. Barbaro put his half spectacles down on the circular table, leaned into the microphone and said that Mr. Koch was projecting a ''subliminal message'' and that ''everybody knows what that means.''\n\nAsked for clarification after the show, Mr. Barbaro replied: ''I am telling you that the message to the white middle class was that he was going to put the minorities in their place.''\n\nThat, he said as he scooped his notes off the table, is why Mr. Koch is ''so popular.'' Koch Calls Rival 'Desperate'\n\nMr. Koch had plucked his suit jacket off a hook and hurried out to another appointment by the time the charge was explained, but asked about it later, he said that late in campaigns ''desperate'' candidates ''seek to throw mud and invective.''\n\nThe radio debate, only the second of the campaign, started with a 15-minute exchange between Mr. Koch and Assemblyman John A. Esposito, opponents in the Republican primary. Mr. Esposito reiterated his charge that Mr. Koch, a Democrat, was ''creeping into our Republican family,'' and Mr. Koch laughed good-humoredly and said: ''I'm running as a Democrat. I haven't in any way concealed that.''\n\nThen it was the turn of the three Democrats, with Mr. Klenetsky directed to the center seat. ''So he becomes a centrist?'' Mr. Koch asked. ''I don't know what he is, Ed,'' Mr. Barbaro replied. Three years ago Mr. Klenetsky ran as the U.S. Labor Party candidate for Governor of Illinois, and Mr. Koch and Mr. Barbaro did not pay much attention to him yesterday as he reiterated his belief that a policy of ''planned shrinkage'' threatened to turn New York into ''another Hong Kong.'' Finances vs. Services\n\nMr. Koch said that New York was ''in terrible shape'' financially when he moved into City Hall and that he had restored fiscal stability. Mr. Barbaro said city services ''were never worse.''\n\nTheir argument sharpened when Mr. Barbaro said Mr. Koch had ''failed the city transit system'' and had stood at the Brooklyn Bridge ''as a strikebreaker'' during last year's subway and bus strike.\n\nThe Mayor rolled his eyes in a show of impatience. ''It's hard to catch up with all these ridiculous statements,'' he said. ''But I'll try.''\n\nFar from being a ''strikebreaker,'' he said animatedly, he had been ''keeping the city going,'' telling New Yorkers: ''Come on over. Don't let that union bring us to our knees.''\n\nIn contrast with the mayoral candidates and their handful of debates, the candidates for the Democratic nomination for Comptroller have been in broadcast studios almost daily. Yesterday's debate was on WYNY.\n\n''This is a real case of the pot calling the kettle black,'' said the incumbent, Harrison J. Goldin, when h is o pponent, Assemblyman John C. Dearie, noted that Mr. Goldin has bee n the target of several investigations. In retaliation, Mr. Goldin ci ted Mr. Dearie's failureto file several Federal income-tax returns on time.",

        "instruction": "WESTBURY LONG ISLAND motorists have been standing on line long hours at their state motor vehicle offices, primarily because of frequent breakdowns in the recently installed computer system. But they may have to endure even greater delays, if additional changes now being contemplated by state and county officials are instituted.\n\nAt the Nassau County facility in Westbury, the public is now biding its time for an average of two to two and a half hours, as compared with only a 20- to 30-minute wait last year, according to Kathleen R. Martin, the county's agent for the State Motor Vehicle Bureau. She attributed the lines, which often snake through the building, out the door and down the street, to the computer system, in place since May 1.\n\nArthur Felice, the Suffolk County agent for the state, said that the new computer was malfunctioning an average of 35 percent of the time and creating delays up to eight times greater than in previous years. Other officials in Suffolk said that the recent closing of a county-run satellite motor vehicle office in East Northport had also contributed to lengthy backups at the main bureau in Hauppauge.\n\nHowever, state motor vehicle authorities maintained that the difficulty stemmed not from the new Mohawk Data Sciences-Series 25 computer system, but rather from the ''inconsistent'' telephone lines used in concurrence with the computer.\n\nIn hopes of alleviating the problem, the New York Telephone Company is developing a digital system that it plans to try out in several weeks at one New York City office. If it works, the pilot project will be expanded throughout Nassau and Suffolk Counties, according to the New York State Assistant Commissioner of Motor Vehicle Affairs, F. James Williams.\n\nWhile new phone lines may diminish the current waiting times, local motor vehicle authorities warned that motorists should not be buoyed by false hopes for the future.\n\n''They plan to introduce photo licensing here, most likely in 1982,'' said one official, who requested anonymity. ''Quite frankly, if it's done the way they're talking about it, it will set the Motor Vehicle Bureau back about 20 years.''\n\nPhoto licensing, used extensively throughout the United States, is already a statute of law in New York State, but not yet in effect here. It mandates that all driver's licenses bear the photograph of the licensee.\n\nThe county agents suggested the photos should be taken at the county bureaus and then developed, processed and distributed immediately. They have heard, however, that the state may require that all rolls of film be forwarded to Albany for processing - a plan, they said, that could lead to ''utter chaos.''\n\nIn Albany, though, Mr. Williams said the system for photo licensing had yet to be established. Moreover, in Suffolk County, where the satellite bureau was recently shut down, prospects for the continuation of the three remaining county offices are uncertain at best.\n\n''Closing East Northport was only a beginning,'' Mr. Felice said. He contended that area residents had adapted well to the demise of their neighborhood office.\n\nOn the other hand, County Legislator John J. O'Neil of East Northport said his constituents were finding it difficult and inconvenient to travel the additional eight miles to Hauppauge.''There's the extra wait created at Hauppauge, and, of course, the expensive gasoline,'' Mr. O'Neil said. ''It's got so bad that a trip to the Motor Vehicle Bureau means taking a half-day off from work.''\n\nNonetheless, in his forthcoming 1982 budget, Suffolk County Executive Peter F. Cohalan is expected to recommend that the county offer to turn over the operation of three remaining satellite offices to the state as an economy measure. The state, however, is ill prepared to accommodate such a request.\n\n''The possibility has never even been posed to us,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It would mean a lot of legalities would have to be overcome.''\n\nHe noted that a major stumbling block would be the state's reluctance to take over the employment of county workers. While both state and county employees work at the various motor vehicle bureaus, they are represented by separate unions and have different pay scales.\n\nAccording to Mr. Williams, the state agency is feeling a financial pinch, and it is not likely to take on the burden of additional facilities at this time.\n\nIn contrast, both Mr. Felice and Mrs. Martin said the state was far better off financially than either of the counties, because the state got the ''lion's share'' of all motor vehicle revenues.\n\n''Between the computers and the money shortages, I'm becoming e desperate woman,'' Mrs. Martin said. She noted that Nassau grossed roughly $26 million last year from motor-vehicle revenues, but received back only $999,000 for its operating expenses.\n\n''There has to be a more equitable distribution of the revenues between county and state,'' Mrs. Martin said. Last year Nassau taxpayers subsidized nearly $1 million of the Nassau bureau's expenses.\n\nIn Suffolk, taxpayers had to make up the difference between $989,000 returned as revenues and operating costs of $2.2 million. Mr. Felice said the State Legislature had not increased the funds given back to the counties since 1969.\n\nIn both counties, authorities advise drivers not to procrastinate when it comes time to renew a permit or a license. Mr. Felice said he told people that ''an envelope and an 18-cent stamp will save them a lot of time standing on line - but they always seem to wait until the last moment.''\n\nEmerging triumphant from the Westbury Motor Vehicle Bureau, a permit renewal in her hand, Julie Mayer, a local resident, checked her stopwatch.\n\n''This is really a good day here,'' she said. ''It only took me 54 minutes, 55 seconds, and 2,400ths of a second.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of waiting line at Nassau Motor Vehicles Bureau",

When rainfall is lacking, deep-soak plants once a week. Patio tubs may need water once a day. Pinch out old flowers as soon as they fade, particularly petunias, verbenas, geraniums and snapdragons, to encourage continuous bloom. Biennials: Plant seed of columbine, English daisies and Canterbury bells to flower next year. Iris: Carefully dig and divide clumps of 3-or-4-year-old plants; discard old centers, renew soil and replant. Climbing roses: Cut to the ground a third of the old canes to rejuvenate plants.\n\nVegetables and Fruit As soon as the harvest is complete, plant rows with a follow-up crop. Plant vegetables that mature in a short season (60 days): bush beans, beets, carrots, radishes, kohlrabi. Indoors start seed of kale, cabbage and broccoli to set outdoors at the end of the month for late fall harvest. Last call to apply mulch between vegetable garden rows to preserve soil moisture and keep down weeds. Use partly dried grass clippings, clean straw or spoiled hay. Fruit trees: Spray every two weeks with a general-purpose mixture of insecticides for control of chewing and sucking pests and a fungicide to protect from spots, rust and fungus diseases. Raspberries: Prune to the ground canes that have borne fruit to keep brambles under control and promote next year's crop. Strawberries: Thin rows either by running a mower over them or by hoeing out excess runners. Trees and Shrubs Contract with arborists to thin out overgrown shade trees and remove dead or weakened limbs. Have limbs cut to size; stockpile to dry for the wood stove or fireplace. In case of drought, do not neglect watering new or shallow-rooted trees such as dogwood and fruit trees. Hedges: Abundant rainfall has spurred growth; trim them back and try to follow their natural outline rather than chopping them off into stiff shapes. Softwood cuttings: Take cuttings of azaleas, forsythia, roses, spirea and other favorite shrubs. Insert in a moist half-and-half mixture of sand and peat. Keep in light shade, where they will root in six weeks or so. Birds Put a bird bath near shrubbery where there is shelter from predators. Keep it clean and filled daily with fresh water. If nestlings are ever found on the ground, allow parents to rescue them; they usually know best. Lawns Set mowers to cut high, at least two inches. Do not use herbicides for weed control in hot weather. Brown patches may indicate chinch bugs or fungus diseases. Wait until the end of next month to do any seeding or sodding. Pests and Diseases Gypsy moth caterpillars are pupating; destroy shiny brown pupa cases by scraping them into paper bags. Set traps for Japanese beetles. Scalloped leaf edges on rhododendrons or yellowing of yew indicate black vine weevil; protect foliage and drench ground underneath with Orthene (acephate). Check frequently fuchsia, ivy geraniums, lantana for white fly; control with soap sprays. Control aphids that spread viral diseases. Check squash for stem borers. Protect lilac, zinnia and phlox foliage from mildew. Use Funginex to control mildew and black spot on roses.",

But at a time like that, who wants to be a poop?\n\nInstead, I ask: How do we feel? We the fans. We the consumers. In Atlanta, not only do they trot out the cartoon image of the Braves, but the fans also perform a chant with a chopping motion, which would be idiotic even if it did not have racist implications.\n\nWhen I see Atlanta fans performing the chop, I want to ask an old liberal from the 1960's -- somebody who used to be on the right side -- what she thinks of stereotypes of American Indians. But Jane Fonda is married to Rich Ted, and she doesn't do protest anymore.\n\nIf you stop to think about it -- as I have been forced to do by writing this column -- it really is offensive to take a people whose religion, whose love of the land, whose suffering, is intrinsically mixed with race, and turn them into mascots. These conditions go back to earlier times, like the 1948 World Series, when white people didn't have to think about this stuff. But now we do.\n\nMiddle-of-the-road America (code phrase for white America) wakes up one morning and discovers, gee, jurors may have been influenced by their own racial identity in the O. J. Simpson trial. How disturbing. Or Middle America discovers, gee, nearly half a million black American men are convening in Washington, and a man named Farrakhan, why, he sounds angry. How disturbing. Then anybody who can afford a ticket goes to the ball park and performs some stupid chop and wears a ball cap with a grinning American Indian on it. The choppers don't get it.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask these two ball clubs to change their names? Universities like Stanford and St. John's actually did, and others have agonized over it. But at Florida State University, Chief Seminole -- bare-chested warrior on horseback, wielding a spear -- leads the football team onto the field. That college always trots out some real Seminoles who say they are not offended by the use of a warrior as a mascot for smash-mouth, roid-rage, beefed-up alleged student-athletes.\n\nPlus, the latter-day George Preston Marshall who currently owns the professional football team in the American capital (named Jack Kent Cooke, what is it with these three-name guys?), isn't about to give up the trappings and the income of the Washington Redskins.\n\nThere is a glorious heritage in these teams: Sammy Baugh, Bobby Mitchell, Henry Aaron, Mike Garcia. We won't see these nicknames changed in the short run. But I suggest that fans refrain from buying any souvenir with those degrading symbols. Some marketing executive just might get it.",

        "instruction": "With its decision to grant a Federal tax exemption to segregated private schools, the Reagan Administration has moved from a lack of interest in fighting racial discrimination to active promotion of it.\n\nNever mind the sophistical explanation being offered. An 11-yearold Federal policy - first in effect under President Nixon - has been reversed. The reversal restores tax exemption to more than 100 private schools and other organizations that had lost it because they practiced segregation.\n\nMany more segregated schools that have never been tax-exempt will now gain that status. And new segregated schools will be organized to take advantage of the policy reversal. Those who contribute to any of these schools can take a Federal tax deduction for doing so; and all the schools will be excused from paying unemployment, Social Security and Federal income taxes.\n\nIf that isn't actively promoting racial discrimination, what is? And it's out of the taxpayers' pockets at that. No wonder, therefore, that Representative Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn declared in Richmond, Va., in services memorializing Martin Luther King Jr.:\n\n''The dreams of the 60's and 70's have turned into the shrinking reality of the 80's. ... We (blacks) must realize that the gains made during the past 15 years are being taken away one by one.''\n\nHere's only a partial record:\n\n* The Reagan Administration has said it will no longer seek or enforce busing orders for school desegregation.\n\n* The Justice Department will seek reversal of a Supreme Court decision approving a voluntary affirmative action program - despite President Reagan's apparent approval of it at a news conference.\n\n* Mr. Reagan wants to water down a 10-year extension of the Voting Rights Act already passed by the House.\n\n* Neither he nor the Justice Department has lifted a finger to oppose a pending Senate bill that would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction in school segregation cases.\n\nThere's plenty more. Mr. Reagan's budget cuts have hit hardest at minorities and the poor. His economic policies have produced 8.9 percent unemployment - a figure expected to hang above 9 percent in coming months -and that translates into 16.1 percent unemployment for blacks, a rate near the record.\n\nBut at least the Administration can argue plausibly that busing hasn't worked, although there's ample evidence to the contrary. It claims to be opposed only to ''goals and quotas,'' not to affirmative action itself. And Mr. Reagan belatedly says he supports extension of the Voting Rights Act - but only with the changes he wants.\n\nSimilarly, the Administration now argues that its tax-exemption ruling is not an endorsement of school segregation. The nondiscrimination policy of the last 11 years, it says, gives the Internal Revenu e Service too much power; only Congress should have the authority to decide who gets tax exemption and who doesn't.\n\nThat does not just happen to be what discriminatory schools like Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., have been saying in Federal court. It does not just happen to be the reverse of what the Justice Department was telling the courts as recently as September. It does not just happen to fly in the face of a three-judge Federal court's order in 1971, later affirmed by the Supreme Court, holding that the Government could not legally grant tax exemption to racially discriminatory private schools.\n\nAll of that is quite deliberate, as is the Administration's ignoring of the fact that Congress has had ample opportunity in 11 years to legislate policy if it felt the need, or to change existing policy - which was, in fact, at least partially based on legislative history as unanimously interpreted by the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations.\n\nNot even the most ardent Reaganites will be able to claim a ''mandate'' from the people for Mr. Reagan's reversal of this longstanding and widely accepted Federal effort to penalize existing discrimination and prevent more. But it's not hard to see why the Administration acted as it did.\n\nIts decision to reward segregated schools pleases many hard-right conservatives - not just Southerners -and is a sop to Chairman J. Str om Thurmond of the Senate Judiciary Commit tee. It lines up the Administration with the Mormon Church and wit h numerous fundamentalist religious groups that, like Bo b Jones University, profess to find biblical authority for racial segregation. Mr. Reagan's previous emphasis on the economy, ra ther than on ''social issues,'' has not pleased these elements.\n\nNor does the President think he has much to fear from blacks, few of whom ever supported him. But he may learn better, as have others before him, if they heed Shirley Chisholm's advice: ''Get your marching boots ready!''",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Nov. 25— It is just after 10 o'clock on a Thursday morning in the somnolent chamber of the House of Representatives. The chaplain has prayed for all 14 lawmakers present, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. has given his blessing to the previous day's journal and three messages from the Senate have been duly received.\n\nOne of the four members in the front row seats, Representative Jim Wright, rises, and the Speaker greets him: ''The gentleman from Texas.''\n\n''I request permission to address the House for one minute,'' the Congressman says, exercising his priority as majority leader. ''The gentleman is recognized for not to exceed one minute,'' the Speaker responds.\n\nA Moment at the Lectern\n\nMr. Wright strides to a lectern in the well of the chamber facing the Democratic seats, which lie to the Speaker's right. He puts his one-page text on the lectern and booms into the microphone: ''Mr. Speaker, the House has twice voted by overwhelming margins ... .''\n\nThe ''morning hour,'' a Congressional ritual that has taken on new meaning with the penetration of the House chamber by television, had begun. In the next 32 minutes, 19 more members each delivered themselves of one minute's worth of oratory on the subject of their choice, to an audience that consisted almost entirely of people waiting to make one-minute speeches.\n\nLike much of the oratory if not the decision-making in Congress, the morning hour is actually addressed to an audience other than the visible one. On this Thursday, there were only 53 spectators looking on and a solitary reporter in the press gallery. Some of the speeches were barely audible above the conversational murmur of members socializing in the back of the hall.\n\nSome participants in the morning hour were really addressing the readers of the Congressional Record, where their words would appear the next day. Many of them will make reprints of their remarks in the Record and mail them to constituents, giving the vague impression that the speeches were delivered at the climax of a tumultuous House debate. Film Clips Available\n\nPerhaps most important, the one-minute speeches were also delivered before the unblinking television cameras that have recorded the proceedings of the House for the past 32 months. Any member may now buy a film clip of any speech from the House clerk's office and offer it to his local television stations as a news item, in much the same way that news releases are distributed to the print media.\n\nThe ritualistic character of morning hour turns out to be fairly flexible. Most speakers request and receive permission to ''revise and extend'' their remarks, polishing up the printed version and adding material beyond the one-minute limit.\n\nOn the Thursday in question, for some reason, Representative Wright did not seek such editing permission, but the version of his speech that appeared in the Congressional Record was nevertheless his formal text and not the more freewheeling paraphrase he actually delivered.\n\nBut the next speaker, Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr. of Indiana, apparently revised himself right out of the Record. His mildly irreverent remarks on Administration Social Security policy - ''give them someday their daily bread, under certain conditions'' - do not appear in the official transcript of the morning hour at all.\n\nMorning hour messages range widely. Two Republicans directed their remarks at Speaker O'Neill: Representative Dan E. Lungren of California blamed ''Tiponomics'' for inflation and high interest rates, but Representative Lynn Martin of Illinois read a magazine snippet that called the Speaker ''an enormously affectionate teddy bear.''\n\nIt is difficult to determine how much the lure of television has fed the institution of the morning hour. The House clerk's office reports that no records are kept ''for First Amendment reasons'' of how many members buy film clips, apparently lest the tally have a chilling effect on freedom of publicity. But House aides who have watched the ceremony for years are convinced there are more oneminute speeches since the cameras began rolling.\n\nHouse rules prohibit any member from using the television recordings of sessions ''for political purposes,'' which has been carefully defined as inclusion in campaign commercials for radio or television. But House rules bind only House members, and anyone can buy the film clips. Film Bought by Challengers\n\nIn the 1980 elections, candidates challenging House incumbents, in at least two instances, bought House television clips of their opponents, focused on the less glamorous and coherent segments of their floor speeches and used the negative material in campaign commercials.\n\nThe Senate has a version of the morning hour, called ''routine morning business,'' which like many things in that body, is windier and less tightly organized. Members are given time for speeches on any subject, but the segments are likely to be at least 15 or 30 minutes. No self-respecting senator, it seems, could contemplate saying anything at all in one minute.\n\nIn routine morning business, the Senate chamber is even more empty than the House at morning hour; senators generally do not arrive on the floor until just before their time slot opens. Occasionally, to avoid the solitary echo of his own voice, a senator will organize a sort of mock debate, inviting a handful of like-minded colleagues to join him on the floor and provide background oratory.\n\nA resolution authorizing television cameras in the Senate for the first time has been approved in committee and is scheduled for floor debate in coming months. If it is approved, the Senate's routine morning business may come less routine and more businesslike in the future.",

        "instruction": "THE conviction of the Nassau County Republican leader, Joseph M. Margiotta, for extortion is not likely to turn Long Island voters away from his party, political leaders and observers from both parties said after the verdict became known.\n\n''It would be a grave error for any politician to think that using the conviction as an issue is the way to the top,'' said Richard Kessel, a consumer advocate who has also been a persistent critic of Nassau Republican officials. ''The fact is that the fee-splitting issue has been before the public for a long time now. It was a big issue this past November, and it made absolutely no difference.''\n\nThe issue has been before the public because the conviction of Mr. Margiotta, one of the state's most powerful political figures, came after his second trial on charges that he had forced the county's insurance agent to split his fees with numerous Republican supporters who did no work for the money.\n\nMr. Margiotta, who is 54 years old, has served as the Republican leader of the Town of Hempstead since 1967 and as the party's county chairman since 1968. He was also a State Assemblyman from 1966 to 1977. His first trial ended in a hung jury last April.\n\nBefore the retrial, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and 22 New York members of the the House of Representatives, including virtually all the state's Republicans and eight Democrats, sent a letter to the Justice Department accusing Edward R. Korman, the United States Attorney who initiated the Federal indictment, of ''what appears to be a serious case of prosecutorial misconduct'' and called on the department to investigate it.\n\nMr. Korman, who plans to step down as Federal prosecutor when his term expires next August, called the conviction of Mr. Margiotta ''a victory for the people of Nassau County, who have been victimized by years of institutionalized corruption at a cost to the taxpayers of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars.''\n\nIf Mr. Margiotta's conviction is upheld after the appeals process is exhausted, he could lose his political postion, be disbarred as a lawyer and get a prison sentence.\n\nMr. Margiotta was found guilty of one fraud count, which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, and five related extortion counts, each carrying up to 20 years. He remains free wthout bail while awaiting sentence.\n\nMr. Margiotta contended throughout the case that he had merely conducted a traditional system of political patronage that ended in 1978. But the prosecutor charged that he had abused the system and turned it into a fraudulent scheme to extort kickbacks for more than 10 years.\n\nThe major issue in the case was whether Mr. Margiotta had made a ''secret deal'' for an insurance agency to handle the county's municipal insurance in return for the agency's agreement to give half of the commissions to political supporters who did no work on the insurance.\n\nMr. Margiotta testified that he had ''never, never'' made a deal with the agency and had simply selected politically loyal brokers to receive insurance commisions that the agency was sharing under a traditional patronage system. The prosecution contended that the payments amounted to extortion because the agency's owner had feared losing the highly profitable municipal business if he failed to pay Mr. Margiotta's supporters.\n\nDuring his campaign against Francis T. Purcell for Nassau County Exective this year, the Democratic candidate, John W. Matthews, tried to exploit the Margiotta trial disclosures by tying the incumbent to his party leader, but Mr. Purcell was elected by a huge landslide. Republicans in the county, in general, won by their biggest margins ever.\n\nThe G.O.P. victory was achieved despite the scandals that have plagued the Republicans for several years, including the bribery conviction, just before the November elections, of the Purcell administration's General Services Commissioner, Francis O'Connor, a party leader, and the acknowledgement of a system of collecting 1 percent of political appointees' salaries for party contributions.\n\n''It didn't affect the Republicans in Nassau, and we had one of our best years ever here in Suffolk too,'' said the Suffolk County Republican leader, Anthony Prudenti.\n\nMr. Prudenti also said he did not expect the conviction to affect the strength of the Nassau and Suffolk Republican organizations statewide either. ''The people of Nassau and Suffolk make up 40 percent of the Republican vote in primaries, so our strength won't be diminished at all,'' he said.\n\nMr. Prudenti's own party in Suffolk was recently brushed by scandal but emerged, nevertheless, still firmly in control of the county although still somewhat split into factions. Republican voters in the county showed in their primary voting for Suffolk County Executive in 1980 that they did indeed blame John V.N. Klein, then the County Executive, for the troubles of the Southwest Sewer District. But in the general election they showed that they were not extending that blame to Republicans in general.\n\nThis year, Suffolk Repulicans had to withstand the notoriety of the trial of the former Smithtown Republican leader, Nicholas Barbato, who had been the mentor of Mr. Klein and the de facto county leader. He was found not guilty in October of charges that he promoted the sewer project in return for bribes that had been extorted from contractors. Despite the verdict, the trial highlighted the fact that the sewer project had been handled in a corrupt manner and had been pushed ahead mainly by a Republican-controlled County Legislature that was responding to political pressure from Mr. Barbato.\n\nDespite this, as Mr. Prudenti pointed out, Suffolk voters stayed with their traditional party of choice, the Republicans. In both counties, Republicans have a 3-2 enrollment edge and they, in effect, increase that edge by alliances with the Conservative Party, the third-ranking party in the state and on the Island.\n\nDuring the court proceedings, Mr. Margiotta was not left alone in court to bear his trial as was Mr. Barbato, whose trial took place after Mr. Klein left office. Politicians from both parties not only expressed their support in person by testifying in Mr. Margiotta's behalf but also contributed to his defense fund. None of the Democratic officeholders reached after the verdict said they intended to try to use the conviction to grab control from the Republicans. Instead, they expressed sympathy for Mr. Margiotta.\n\nWhy the voters in Nassau and Suffolk have not reacted against the Republican party because of the Southwest Sewer District and the fee-splitting case is open to speculation. Vincent A. Suozzi, a Democrat who lost his re-election bid to remain as Mayor of Glen Cove by a narrow margin, laid it to voter apathy.\n\nMr. Kessel said he was convinced that Nassau residents ''do not vote Republican because of Joe Margiotta -most people do not even know who he is.'' Most Long Islanders, as political scientists have long pointed out, are Republican because of such factors as their economic status and their dwelling in suburbia.\n\nIndeed, said Mr. Kessel, the conviction will probably ''unite the party here because they feel Margiotta was picked on because he was so strong and so successful.''\n\nThe last time Democrats won control of the County Executive post in Nassau County was more than a decade ago, when Eugene H. Nickerson captured the seat after disclosures of Republican scandals.",

        "instruction": "UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., April 29— An 11th-hour effort was made here today to avert a threatened confrontation between the Reagan Administration and African nations over sanctions against South Africa.\n\nNoel Dorr, the President of the Security Council, proposed a compromise that would postpone a vote on sanctions for at least a month. In exchange, all Council members and notably the United States would commit themselves without qualification to the plan for United Nations-supervised elections to create an independent Namibia out of the South African-administered territory of South-West Africa.\n\nTonight, however, Olara Otunnu of Uganda, the African spokesman, rejected Mr. Dorr's proposal as ''unacceptable.'' He said the Africans were proceeding with the vote for sanctions tomorrow.\n\nThe central problem with Mr. Dorr's proposal was whether it was strong enough to satisfy other African nations or whether it was too strong for the United States and its Western allies.\n\nIn London last week, the United States and four other Western powers appeared to qualify their backing for the supervised elections, calling the plan a ''solid base for a transition'' to a free Namibia that might require ''strengthening.'' The Africans, in turn, have been pressing the West to fix a timetable for the territory's independence from South Africa.\n\nBut Mr. Dorr's intervention did illuminate one point: some key African nations, those nearest South Africa, are in no hurry to press for a vote on sanctions. For one thing, they know it will be an empty gesture since any resolution is almost certain to be vetoed by the United States and Britain. Not Eager to Push Reagan\n\nFor another, the so-called frontline states - Angola, Mozambique, Botswana, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe -also know that a clash with the United States would defeat their own ends. These nations believe that only Washington can induce South Africa to give up South-West Africa and so are not eager to push the Reagan Administration into a corner.\n\nSince April 21 the Africans and others have been delivering angry speeches in the Council, denouncing South Africa for stalling a Western plan to free the territory. The South Africans had agreed to the plan in principle, but last January they refused to fix a date for the first step, a cease-fire with the South-West Africa People's Organization, the Soviet-supported insurgents fighting for the territory's independence.\n\nNot until today, however, did the Africans formally introduce their resolutions calling for a complete cutoff of relations with South Africa.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Otunnu of Uganda insisted that African patience had been exhausted. ''It has been said that we should continue to wait,'' he said in the Council. ''We have waited for 15 years for the Council to take decisive measures.'' Vote on Sanctions Due\n\nLater, at a news conference, Mr. Otunnu said that ''there doesn't seem to be anything in the offing to change our plans'' for a vote tomorrow on sanctions.\n\nThe African move led to the compromise offer from Mr. Dorr, who has gained a reputation here for his negotiating skill. The Dorr proposal strongly urged ''all states concerned to use every means to facilitate the implemention'' of Resolution 435. This is the 1978 resolution calling for the early independence of South-West Africa through elections supervised by the United Nations. It is this resolution that the United States and the other Western powers meeting in London appeared to qualify their support for.",

Noel Dorr, the President of the Security Council, proposed a compromise that would postpone a vote on sanctions for at least a month. In exchange, all Council members and notably the United States would commit themselves without qualification to the plan for United Nations-supervised elections to create an independent Namibia out of the South African-administered territory of South-West Africa."

        "instruction": "CANTON, Miss. — The United Auto Workers, desperate to make inroads in the anti-union South, where Toyota, Volkswagen, and other foreign automakers have assembly plants, has never tried a unionization drive quite like the one at the Nissan plant here.\n\nIt has enlisted thousands of union members in Brazil to picket Nissan dealerships there as the company prepares to co-sponsor the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The union has sent a team of Mississippi ministers and workers to South Africa, where Nissan has an assembly plant, to try to embarrass the company with accusations that it violates workers’ rights at the Canton plant.\n\nOver the next few weeks, a delegation of UAW leaders and supporters will go to Tokyo and Paris, the headquarters of Renault, Nissan’s partner, to publicize a report by a Cornell University professor that asserts Nissan’s managers have illegally threatened to close the Mississippi plant if workers vote to unionize.\n\nChip Wells supports unionization, citing unequal treatment of workers.\n\nThese efforts are largely directed at Nissan’s part-Brazilian, part-French chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, a renowned cost cutter who said the company prefers communicating with its Mississippi workers without a union.\n\nCloser to home, the actor Danny Glover has embraced the UAW’s cause, speaking at colleges across the South to recruit students to distribute union fliers at Nissan dealerships. The union has also helped create a group of students and community and religious leaders, the Mississippi Alliance for Fairness at Nissan, which includes the NAACP. The alliance often uses the slogan, “Labor Rights Are Civil Rights.”\n\nAt a time when the UAW has fewer than one-third of the 1.5 million workers it had in 1979, its organizing push in the South has taken on urgency and is being watched by labor leaders across the country.\n\n“It’s a life-and-death matter for the UAW to succeed in the South,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor and labor historian at the University of California Santa Barbara. “That’s why they’ve put their best organizers into this campaign.”\n\nThe unionization battle has badly divided workers at the gleaming white Nissan plant here, which stretches four-fifths of a mile along Interstate 55 and produces 450,000 Altimas, Sentras, and other vehicles a year. The pro-union forces say many workers are backing the UAW, while anti-union workers insist the union has little chance of gaining majority backing.\n\nSome anti-union workers wear T-shirts saying, “If you want a union, go to Detroit.”\n\nDespite the union’s previous failures in the South, Bob King, the UAW’s president, has undertaken its most ambitious campaign in the region. In addition to Canton, it is also pushing to organize Volkswagen’s plant in Chattanooga and the Daimler-Benz plant in Vance, Ala.\n\n“Bob King has basically staked his legacy on organizing these international assembly plants,” said Kristin Dziczek, director of the labor and industry group at the Center for Automotive Research. “Unless they unionize more of the automotive workforce in the country, they will become wage takers, not wage setters.”\n\nThe union faces rough going in Mississippi, she said, considering the embarrassing loss it suffered in 2001 when workers at Nissan’s plant in Smyrna, Tenn., voted 2 to 1 against joining the UAW.\n\n“What’s different this time is there is really strong and active community support,” he said.\n\nStephanie Sutton says the UAW overstates the support it has and stands to lose a vote on unions at the plant.\n\nNissan has invested $2 billion in its state-of-the-art plant, which uses 1,200 robots. The base wage for most of the plant’s workers is $23.22 an hour, making them the envy of many blue-collar workers in Mississippi.\n\nNonetheless, Morris Mock, a muscular paint technician, strongly backs unionization.\n\n“We’re grateful that Nissan came to Mississippi, but as I grow older, I see that there are safety issues and ergonomic issues that need to be addressed,” said Mock, 39, who has worked at the plant since it opened. “Nissan started out one way, then things changed.”\n\nMany workers are upset that their wages were frozen for five years and that the plant has hired hundreds of temporary workers, many of them starting around $12 an hour. Experienced workers complain that they are relegated to night shifts because the temporary workers are often given the coveted day shifts.\n\n“They give them the easier jobs so they won’t leave,” said Chip Wells, a paint technician.\n\nStill, Stephanie Sutton, a paint technician for 10 years, insists that the union has less support than it realizes. She said many workers are speaking out for a union to pressure Nissan to give larger raises but will not vote for the UAW.\n\n“You have a lot of people who talk the talk, but I don’t know if they’re going to stand up when it counts,” she said.",

It's the cardinal sin of Broadcast 101. But striking the right chord takes hard work. How hard? We asked three New York newswomen - an anchor, a correspondent and a meteorologist - to talk about dressing for on-air success.\n\nJANICE HUFF, \"News Channel 4\" meteorologist\n\nWhen it comes to dressing for work, Janice Huff doesn't worry about the weather. She worries about the weather map.\n\n\"Being a meteorologist, you're allowed a little more expression,\" says Huff, the weekday meteorologist for WNBC's \"News Channel 4.\" \"The rules aren't as strict as they are for an anchor. You can't wear stripes or plaids or polka dots in front of the weather maps, but there's a little more leeway with color.\"\n\nNot that it's a challenge for the Manhattan-born, South Carolina-reared Huff. Known for her massive shoe collection as much as her raucous sense of humor, Huff admits\n\nshe loves to shop, so in her decade in New York, she has built a substantial on-air wardrobe of jackets and suits.\n\nMore, she has no use for label snobbery. \"People can't tell if it's Armani or Old Navy on TV. So I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot.\"\n\nInstead, she shops anywhere and everywhere, from Saks Fifth Avenue to the Woodbury Common Outlet center to sample sales and H&M. (The network gives her no clothing stipend.)\n\n\"I got my sense of style from my mother,\" says Huff, whose mother lived in Harlem for 25 years. \"She had not a lot of clothes, not a lot of shoes, but she was always classic.\"\n\nTo this day, Huff still wears an old coat of her mother's (and keeps her 1988 Lincoln Town Car, too) and has no qualms about sporting a 10-year-old jacket.\n\n\"We get so many calls, 'You were wearing nice earrings last night. My wife liked them, and I'd love to get them for our anniversary. Where did you get them?' I have to tell them, 'I don't know. I got them three or four years ago.'\"\n\nBut truth be known, Huff's true passion is for shoes, the one thing viewers rarely see. Recently, she showed up on \"Live at Five\" in a red jacket and red Chuck Taylor high-top Converse sneakers. \"Sue Simmons thought they were a riot and insisted that I show them,\" Huff said.\n\nHer philosophy: Less is more. She is, she says, the queen of flip-flops. \"I have them in every type, color and price.\n\nBecause I grew up in a warm climate, most of the time I don't wear shoes in the house. Even in winter. The truth is, I don't like anything on my feet.\"\n\nMARTHA MacCALLUM, \"Fox News Live\" anchor\n\nIt's 3 p.m. on a Friday, and \"Fox News Live\" anchor Martha MacCallum is racing out of the ground-floor broadcast studio and up to a third-floor conference room. She has one hour, two dozen racks of clothes, an undisclosed budget and the right to \"buy\" pieces for her on-air fall wardrobe - all at Fox News Channel's expense.\n\nEven for a woman whose job it is to be totally unflustered by drama, it's a kid-in-the-candy- store experience. MacCallum, who joined Fox in January 2004, is both tickled by the indulgence of the \"trunk show\" and workmanlike about what she wants from it: a look that is polished, professional and won't distract from the important stuff.\n\n\"A lot depends on the time of day you're on the air,\" says the thirtysomething MacCallum, who anchors the 2-3 p.m. newscast. \"You can have a more-or-less casual look on the morning shows - a sweater on your shoulder, say - and as you go through the day, the style gets more sophisticated.\"\n\nThe trunk show is Fox's semi-annual rite of style in which anchors and correspondents -\n\n115 in all - get to shop, one at a time, till they drop. Or until their hour's up. The event is organized by in-house stylist Gwen Marder and her staff, who scour between 90 and 100 Seventh Avenue showrooms for anchorwear.\n\nMarder sticks to suit makers such as Kasper and Zelda and separates from funkier labels,\n\nincluding Tocca, Lafayette 148, Pink Tartan and Magaschoni. The average staffer winds up with 20 pieces.\n\nMarder calls MacCallum, the mother of two boys and a girl, all under 10, one of her savviest customers.\n\n\"I like clean lines - no buttons and bows,\" says MacCallum, who says her role model is Jane Pauley.\n\nAt the end of the hour, MacCallum's tally includes a turquoise cashmere sweater and turquoise tweed skirt, a trim gray wool skirt with ruffled hem and cashmere cable cardigan, a sleek navy suit and a navy Prada-esque skirt.\n\n\"I think I did great,\" she says. \"It reminds me of when we used to go school shopping and\n\nwould come home and my mom would say, 'We did great!' and you knew she was spinning it for my father.\"\n\nWhen the first blizzard of the season roared across New York last January, pounding the city with 50-mile-per-hour winds and 18 inches of snow, TV reporters throughout the area donned their fattest parkas, galoshes and hoods.\n\nNot Alina Cho. For her standup in Central Park, the petite CNN correspondent was the embodiment of chic: black Searle jacket, silver faux-fur hat and eye-popping Pucci snowboots. Neither snow nor ice was going to rob this 34-year-old reporter of style.\n\n\"There's a lot of pressure to look good,\" says Cho, who landed at CNN 15 months ago. \"You want to look professional, but you're a woman, so you want to look chic, too.\"\n\nCho has no trouble telling the difference. An admitted clothes horse, she pops into Bergdorf Goodman at least once a week in search of a suit, skirt or jacket that can rotate into her wardrobe, which already fills her bedroom closet and spills into a spare room. Her \"gold standard\": CNN colleague Paula Zahn, whose look is at once stylish and effortless.\n\n\"Paula is one of the best interviewers in the business,\" says Cho, who pays for her own clothes. \"And she looks fabulous every night. She complimented me the other day on my suit, and I was so excited.\"\n\nIt's a far cry from her early days in TV in Chicago, when her mother took her to Ann Taylor and bought her four basic suits and urged her to mix and match. These days, Cho says, she knows which designers work best for her - Dolce & Gabbana, Michael Kors, Tuleh, Zac Posen - and sticks with them.\n\nStill, designer dressing is not always practical. Before she headed to Smoketown, Pa. (pop. 119), a few weeks ago to cover the pilot who nearly crashed into the White House, Cho raced home to throw on jeans. Twelve hours after she got back, she was off to Groton, Conn., to cover the planned closing of a submarine base.\n\nIt's at those moments that Cho also swaps her 4-inch heels for a pair of sneakers. \"I had live shots from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and a story in between, and I was on my feet for a long time. At that point, comfort is the most important thing in life.\"",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, May 8— President Bush is set to announce his first judicial choices on Wednesday, formally entering the high-stakes debate about the ideological shape of the federal courts and their influence over some of the nation's most intensely felt social issues.\n\nThe first nominees, 11 candidates for the federal appeals courts, include several outspoken conservatives who are committed to profound change on issues like the separation of church and state and increasing states' rights. The group is also notable for its inclusion of women and minorities.\n\nThe debate over the courts has ebbed and flowed for more than a decade and is again threatening to turn into a large-scale partisan war. Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny.\n\nThe administration's initial selections seem to reflect a recognition of that delicate political situation. Mr. Bush and his advisers appear to have carefully coordinated the group, leaving off some who have already drawn opposition from Democratic senators while including some certain to be attractive to Democrats, notably Roger Gregory, who officials say will be nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va.\n\nMr. Gregory, a black Richmond lawyer, already sits on that court after being named to it last year by President Bill Clinton during a Congressional recess. In bypassing the Senate, Mr. Clinton complained that Republicans had foiled several of his efforts to place a black judge on the court even though the Middle Atlantic states it covers have a higher percentage of blacks than any of the other 10 regional circuit courts.\n\nAs a recess appointee, Mr. Gregory would have been obliged to leave the court next spring, but his nomination by Mr. Bush and his all but certain confirmation mean he will have a regular lifetime appointment.\n\n''The president has clearly focused on experience and intellect,'' said Timothy Flanigan, the deputy counsel to the president who coordinated the selection process along with Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, ''and he will be nominating an exceptionally distinguished group of lawyers and judges.''\n\n''Seven of these people,'' Mr. Flanigan said, ''are sitting judges, and four of them have argued extensively before the Supreme Court.''\n\nMr. Flanigan also said: ''This president is putting forward an exceptionally diverse slate of nominees. Six are women or minorities.'' One, Miguel Estrada, will be the first Hispanic to be nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is regarded by most lawyers as the second most important court in the nation behind the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Democratic senators have complained sharply about the way the Bush administration has gone about making its judicial choices.\n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said today that the White House was ''trying to create the most ideological bench in the history of the nation.''\n\nMr. Schumer, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee on the courts, said the Senate Democrats met today and discussed their resolve to oppose any extremely conservative nominees.\n\nSince no one can become a judge without the agreement of the Senate, which is now evenly divided, with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, the Democrats have considerable leverage.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Estrada and Judge Gregory, officials say, the nominees include John G. Roberts Jr., a Washington lawyer and former deputy solicitor general who will be nominated to the District of Columbia Circuit. Mr. Roberts was nominated to that post by President Bush's father nine years ago, but his nomination was not taken up by the Senate. He has argued 33 cases before the Supreme Court and most recently represented a coalition of state attorneys general against Microsoft in a major antitrust case before the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMr. Estrada, who also worked as an assistant solicitor general, has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court and, like Mr. Roberts, is an outspoken conservative.\n\nMr. Bush is also expected to nominate Barrington Parker Jr., a black federal trial judge in New York City and Westchester, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in Manhattan. Judge Parker, whose father was a federal trial judge, was first nominated to the federal bench by President Clinton.\n\nJudge Dennis Shedd, now on the federal trial court in South Carolina and a former top aide to the state's senior Republican, Senator Strom Thurmond, is expected to be nominated to the Fourth Circuit along with Judge Gregory.\n\nAnother nominee to that court is expected to be Judge Terrence Boyle, a federal trial judge in North Carolina and a former aide to Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican.\n\nFor the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, Mr. Bush is expected to nominate Priscilla Owen, a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, and Edith Brown Clement, a federal trial judge in New Orleans.\n\nFor the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati, Mr. Bush is expected to nominate Deborah L. Cook, a sitting justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, and Jeffrey S. Sutton. Mr. Sutton, active in Washington conservative circles, has become the leading litigator in the United States in pressing for modern-day states' rights over the federal government's in several successful lawsuits. In a recent case, Mr. Sutton persuaded the Supreme Court that states may not be sued under federal law for discriminating against their disabled workers.\n\nLike many of the nominees, Mr. Sutton has been actively involved in the programs of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that favors limited government and works to promote its adherents to the federal bench.\n\nMr. Bush is expected to nominate Prof. Michael McConnell of the University of Utah Law School to the Tenth Circuit, based in Denver. Professor McConnell is a leading scholar and litigator in cases arguing that courts have been too rigid in striking down programs because they violate the Constitution's separation of church and state provision. He has favored allowing federal money to be used more freely by religious institutions.\n\nThe list of Mr. Bush's first judicial nominees is also notable for those who have been left off. Three people who were expected to be nominated -- Representative Christopher Cox of California, Carolyn Kuhl of Los Angeles and Peter Keisler of Maryland -- were not in the first batch because of a dispute with the Democratic senators who represent those states.\n\nIn addition to the ideological battle, Senate Democrats are locked in a fight with the White House and Senate Republicans over the arcane issue of ''blue slips,'' which allow senators from a nominee's state to block that nominee's confirmation.\n\n''Until the blue slip issue is resolved, our intention is not to move forward with any judges,'' Mr. Schumer said. The issue affects, for example, whether the Democrats will try to block the elevation of Judge Boyle to the Fourth Circuit. Senator John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, has indicated he will not support that nomination until the administration agrees to name some people previously blocked by Republicans.\n\n''Until we find some constructive process to put people on the court from North Carolina that allows for some balance, I would not be supporting the nomination of Judge Boyle,'' Mr. Edwards said in an interview.\n\nChart/Photos: ''Bush's Likely Nominees'' President Bush is expected to announce his first 11 nominees to the federal courts today.

At 83 percent, this top level is almost all white. And among the white executives, 80 percent are men.\n\n\"The high-tech sector has been an innovation leader, transforming how we live our lives today and driving solutions to some of our greatest societal challenges. Let's harness that creative thinking and entrepreneurship to ensure that the talents of all Americans are fully utilized in this vital industry,\" EEOC Chair Jenny Yang said. \"Standing still is not an option.\"\n\nThough much of the attention focused on women and people of color, Laurie A. McCann, an AARP Foundation attorney, zeroed in on pervasive age discrimination. Citing a Fortune magazine article, she said \"the median age of employees at Twitter is just 28, and at Facebook and Google, the median age is 29. When compared to a median age of 42 for the workforce overall, the message is stark — older workers are persona non grata in technology.\"\n\nEven worse, \"the most amazing fact is that the industry is so unapologetic about it. Rather than try to hide or explain away the lack of age diversity in the sector, they boast about it,\" she said, pointing to industry firms and executives who openly indicate a preference for those under 35 or twentysomethings or digital natives.\n\n\"This distinction (digital natives) is clearly age-based and can be used to screen out older applicants,\" McCann said.\n\nKweilin Ellingrud, a partner with the McKinsey & Co. consulting firm, told the forum that \"it is critical that women and minorities play a significant role in technology\" for three reasons:\n\nIn order to fight bias in any form, Ellingrud said \"some companies beyond technology are putting as much as 15 percent of their senior leadership compensation at risk and tying it to hitting diversity targets.\"\n\nLike Ellingrud, Benjamin Todd Jealous, the immediate past president and CEO of the NAACP and now a partner at Kapor Capital, pointed to the dangers of unconscious bias in the hiring process in his written statement. Among his 10 suggestions for increasing diversity, No. 1 was: \"Remove names and schools from resumes. Hidden bias is very powerful and very real. Studies show that traditional 'Black' sounding names get half the callbacks than 'White' sounding names, even when the resumes are otherwise identical. Removing names also works to mitigate gender bias.\"\n\nHe also suggested that companies \"apply a 'distance traveled' metric when evaluating candidates. For a young scholar from a tough neighborhood, getting into and thriving at a minor state school means overcoming all sorts of adversity, and those real-life skills are enormously valuable to your company. Keep that in mind when you're weighing strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nYet, too often in school, females and people of color have been discouraged from pursuing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).\n\nErin M. Connell, a partner with the Orrick law firm in San Francisco, said \"historically, women and minorities were less likely to study computer science or major in STEM fields, largely because they were discouraged, or not encouraged, to do so. ... This education gap has led to a skills gap, which continues to be the primary driver of hiring disparities in tech jobs today. Unfortunately, statistics illustrate that the problem is not getting better, and in some cases, it is actually getting worse.\"",

        "instruction": "Facebook users can now control their digital afterlives.\n\nThe social media giant unveiled a new tool Thursday that lets users decide what happens to their Facebook accounts after they die — a living will for their social media profiles.\n\nNew settings now let users decide whether their profiles should be deleted outright. Or they can appoint a “legacy contact,” a kind of Internet executor who can manage their online presence.\n\nUntil recently, the status of a Facebook page after the user’s death has been murky at best. Family members of the deceased were able to reach out to the social network and ask to have a page taken down or turned into a memorial.\n\n“I’ve had clients contact me saying, ‘As parents, we were hoping that the page of our deceased child would remain memorialized, but another family member contacted Facebook and said please delete that account,’” said James Lamm, a lawyer at the Minneapolis firm of Gray, Plant, and Mooty, who writes on the topic of digital estate planning on his blog, Digital Passing.\n\nUnder the new protocols, a user’s legacy contact will be able to update a memorial page — including posting a prepared message from the deceased — download the person’s photos and posts, and publish updates at the top of the page.\n\nHowever Facebook will not allow the legacy contact to access private messages sent between users.\n\n“This really grew out of seeing how people use Facebook for this purpose already,” said spokesman Andy Stone. “We’ve seen people use Facebook to grieve a person who has passed away, to remember that person, and to celebrate their life. It became clear to us that we could do more to support those who were grieving.”\n\nFacebook’s new policy follows the lead of Internet search titan Google Inc. In 2013, Google launched its Inactive Account Manager service, which lets friends or family members take control of a deceased person’s Google assets.\n\nGoogle users can decide who will get access and which files will be available. For instance, a woman might let her husband download all the pictures stored in her Google Photos account, but block access to the e-mail messages in her Gmail account.\n\nFacebook’s new policy may be a reaction to efforts by a commission of legislators from various states to adopt a law that makes it easier for the next of kin to access a deceased person’s digital files. Delaware has already passed such legislation, and Massachusetts is considering it.\n\nBut the legislation is opposed by Facebook and other Internet companies because it would give the deceased person’s relatives total access to his or her files. For example, the next of kin would be able to view e-mails that could contain embarrassing information about the deceased and his or her friends. It could also impact the privacy of the people who were in contact with the deceased — revealing identities, for instance, of members of Alcoholics Anonymous who exchange e-mails.\n\nNetChoice — a lobbying organization whose members include Facebook, Google, and Yahoo — supports alternative legislation that would block access to a deceased person’s online files unless the executor of his estate shows that the information is needed to settle his financial affairs or unless the deceased had granted permission to view the files. Such permission could be included in the person’s will, or the person could use a service like Facebook’s new legacy feature or Google’s Inactive Account Manager to express his desires.\n\n“While this is a great first step, I still encourage my clients to deal with this properly in their will or estate plan,” Lamm said.\n\nThe legacy contact designation is part of Facebook’s compassion research initiative, which draws on the work of researchers, engineers, scientists, and psychologists to create a social media environment sensitive to the needs of its users. Facebook has also tweaked its settings to remove deceased users from their “People You May Know” links and birthday calendars. And on memorial pages, Facebook now adds the word “remembering” next to the name of the deceased.\n\n“It’s so simple but so powerful,” said Jed Brubaker, a doctoral candidate in the department of Informatics at the University of California Irvine whose research into how death plays out on social networks informed Facebook’s decision.\n\n“It’s a way to reduce that ambiguity and to make it very clear not only what happened to the person but also what the space is about,” Brubacker said. “If there’s anything that’s clear from death studies, it’s the importance of telling stories. When you tell the story of who someone is, you are implicitly telling a story of who they were for you, and what it is that you have lost.”",

        "instruction": "SINCE Young Werther died from it and Cyrano de Bergerac was so noble about it, unrequited love has been one of the great themes of literature and drama. Now, at last, unrequited love is getting systematic scrutiny from psychologists.\n\nThe first studies to look at the two sides of unrequited love -- the would-be lover and the rejecter -- show there is pain on both sides and, surprisingly, the rejecter often suffers just as much as the rejected.\n\nAnd in studying the dynamics of love that goes unreturned, psychologists are gaining greater understanding of common hurdles in the sometimes tortuous route to finding a lasting love.\n\n\"We rarely hear about the agony of those who are the target of an unwanted love,\" said Dr. Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Case Western Reserve University who has done much of the new research. \"Literature and film almost always tell the story from the viewpoint of the rejected lover. But both rejecters and would-be lovers can end up feeling like victims.\"\n\nThe experience of unrequited love -- not just a minor crush, but an intense, passionate yearning -- is virtually universal at some point in life. Dr. Baumeister and Sara Wotman, a graduate student, found in a study of 155 men and women that only about 2 percent had never loved someone who spurned them, or found themselves the object of romantic passion they did not reciprocate. Their findings will be published later this year in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\n\nDespite the eventual heartbreak that is the destiny of the unrequited lover, by and large the incidents revealed that there was often more unhappiness on the part of the person pursued than on the pursuer. The unrequited lovers spoke of hope and passion before the final disillusionment; those who spurned them told of an initial flattery that soon gave way to bewilderment, guilt and anger at an intrusive, relentless pursuer.\n\nEvaluating the emotional ups and downs in accounts of more than 200 incidents of unrequited love, Dr. Baumeister found that unpleasant emotions like frustration, anger, anxiety, or guilt were mentioned about a third more often in the accounts told by those who had been pursued than in those whose pursuit was futile. Moreover, despite their rejection, most pursuers said they still held a soft spot in their hearts for those who had spurned their love.\n\nTypical was a tale told by a college woman who spent one summer living in a coed dormitory. \"There was one young man whom no one liked, and whom she felt sorry for,\" said Dr. Baumeister. \"One night she and some friends were playing Parcheesi in the basement, and she invited him to join them. He apparently misinterpreted this kindness as romantic interest on her part, and began following her around telling her how much he liked her. She was horrified, but didn't want to hurt his feelings, so she never told him how uninterested in him she was, nor how upset his unwanted attention made her.\" The Pain of Saying 'No'\n\nThe inability to tell an undesired suitor that there is no hope is very common, Dr. Baumeister found. \"The rejecter usually feels guilty and doesn't know how to say 'No' without hurting the pursuer,\" he said. \"So the most common tactic is to lie low, continue to be nice, and wait, hoping the infatuation will fade. It's like a conspiracy of silence, where one person doesn't want to openly speak rejecting words and the other doesn't want to hear it.\"\n\nThat strategy, however, feeds the fantasies of romance of the would-be lover, and so inadvertently encourages pursuit. \"People send mixed messages, saying to the unwanted lover something like, 'You're a nice person, and I'd like to be your friend, but I don't want to get into a relationship just now,' \" said Dr. Baumeister. \"Even when telling the would-be lover the bad news, the rejecters often sugarcoat the rejection with conciliatory words.\"\n\nThe would-be lover sometimes seizes on the positive side of the message, remaining hopeful. Moreover, for most people it is clearer how one goes about wooing someone than how to spurn someone gracefully.\n\n\"The aspiring lover has many guidelines for pursuit -- what to say, how to let them know you like them -- and why to keep going despite an initial cold reaction,\" said Dr. Baumeister. \"There must be a thousand B movies where at first the girl rejects the hero, who persists and wins her in the end. So the would-be lovers just keep trying, like in all those movies.\" Platonic Relationships\n\nThings are not so clear for those who are trying to put off unwanted advances. \"While the pursuer has all these tactics to try, over and over people who were being pursued told us, I didn't know what to say, I never hurt anyone before.\"\n\nOne frequent path to unrequited love is through what starts as a platonic relationship. \"One of the most common stories told by people in our study was of being in a friendship with an undercurrent of attraction on one side,\" said Dr. Baumeister. \"Over and over people said, We were good friends, but I secretly was in love.\"",

        "instruction": "SYRACUSE, N.Y., Aug. 22— The Philadelphia Eagles opened their training camp five weeks ago with 128 players on their roster, which seemed enough. But the team has come up short on manpower at two positions, guard and fullback, for its third pre-season game. That one will be played tomorrow against the New Orleans Saints and televised nationally by NBC from the Carrier Dome here beginning at 1 P.M.\n\nSixty players remain on the roster but not all are healthy and the two guards, Ron Baker and Rich Garza, must play without relief. As for the three fullbacks one, Steve Howell, joined the team this week; another is a rookie, Hubert Oliver, and Perry Harrington, who will start, is not much of a blocker, a quality essential for the position.\n\nThere are so many football players in the preseason period it is hard to believe a team can run out of them or have to alter its offense to accomodate their abilities of one performer. The Eagles may have to do that if Harrington is to remain the No. 1 fullback, which seems likely, and such a change would diminish the role of Wilbert Montgomery, the club's premiere running back.\n\nLeroy Harris, a fearsome lead blocker for Montgomery's off-tackle smashes and sweeps, broke both bones in his left arm while stiffarming the Pittsburgh Steeler rookie cornerback, Anthony Washington, in the last preseason game and he will be out for all or most of the season. His absence will effect the team's style.\n\nHarrington, the club's 1980 second-round draft choice from Jackson State, is faster than Harris and a better outside runner, but that is not what the Eagles need him for. They need a blocker for the brilliant Montgomery, but acquiring one is not so easy.\n\nHowell was the acquisition made by Carl Peterson, the personnel director, this week. Howell had been Miami's third fullback behind Woody Bennett, the former Jet, and Terry Robiskie, and he gained 206 yards for the Dolphins last season, starting only one game.\n\nOf Philadelphia's two healthy guards, Baker moved into the starting lineup after the coach, Dick Vermeil, induced 38-year-old Woody Peoples to retire. Garza is a free agent from Temple who seemed to have little chance to make the team, but Vermeil said of him this week: ''Garza's a football player. He can play here.''\n\nPetey Perot, the other regular guard, is sidelined with a back injury; Dean Miraldi, the second draft choice, has a pulled muscle and Steve Kenney, the top reserve, has a foot problem because of the loss of a toenail.\n\n''You can never have enough good football players,'' said Vermeil. He will have 50 after making the next roster cuts Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe Saints proved portable this week. With a tropical storm threatening, Coach Bum Phillips requested charter of an airplane and on Tuesday brought the squad of 60 and its equipment from the training camp at Vero Beach, Fla., to Syracuse. Workouts have been held in the enclosed stadium, the Carrier Dome, and the players were delighted to get away from the Florida humidity.\n\nBlair Bush, the veteran center for the Cincinnati Bengals who was a first-round draft choice in 1978, has found competition from an unlikely source. Bush has been sharing playing time with Blake Moore, a free agent from Wooster College of Ohio whom the Bengals retained a year ago just to snap the ball in practice. Moore, who at 6 feet 5 inches and 268 pounds is two inches taller and 18 pounds heavier than Bush, attributes his improvement to an offseason weight program. ''I think I have showed I can start and play,'' he said.\n\nAnother speaking out for weight lifting is Dino Hall, the diminutive running back for Cleveland who is 5-7 and 165 pounds. ''I didn't get any bigger,'' he said. ''But I rearranged my body. My waist is down to 30 inches but I'm so much stronger in the upper body. I can block those linebackers now.''\n\nDave Logan, the Browns' star receiver, has been given back the job of holding the ball on placement kicks.",

There were no indications of pain, and it was not known that he was dead until the gradually decreasing respiration ceased altogether.\n\nRev. Dr. GURLEY, of the New-York-avenue Presbyterian Church, immediately on its being ascertained that life was extinct, knelt at the bedside and offered an impressive prayer, which was responded to by all present.\n\nDr. GURLEY then proceeded to the front parlor, where Mrs. LINCOLN, Capt. ROBERT LINCOLN, Mrs. JOHN HAY, the Private Secretary, and others, were waiting, where he again offered a prayer for the consolation of the family.\n\nThe following minutes, taken by Dr. ABBOTT, show the condition of the late President throughout the night:\n\n11 o'clock -- Pulse 44.\n\n11:05 o'clock -- Pulse 45, and growing weaker.\n\n11:10 o'clock -- Pulse 45.\n\n11:15 o'clock -- Pulse 42.\n\n11:20 o'clock -- Pulse 45; respiration 27 to 29.\n\n11:25 o'clock -- Pulse 42.\n\n11:32 o'clock -- Pulse 48, and full.\n\n11:40 o'clock -- Pulse 45.\n\n11:45 o'clock -- Pulse 45; respiration 22.\n\n12 o'clock -- Pulse 48; respiration 22.\n\n12:15 o'clock -- Pulse 48; respiration 21 -- echmos both eyes.\n\n12:30 o'clock -- Pulse 45.\n\n12:32 o'clock -- Pulse 60.\n\n12:35 o'clock -- Pulse 66.\n\n12:40 o'clock -- Pulse 69; right eye much swollen, and echmoses.\n\n12:45 o'clock -- Pulse 70.\n\n12:55 o'clock -- Pulse 80; struggling motion of arms.\n\n1 o'clock -- Pulse 86; respiration 30.\n\n1:30 o'clock -- Pulse 95; appearing easier.\n\n1:45 o'clock -- Pulse 86 -- very quiet, respiration irregular.\n\n2:10 o'clock -- Mrs. LINCOLN retired with ROBERT LINCOLN to an adjoining room.\n\n2:30 o'clock -- President very quiet -- pulse 54 -- respiration 28.\n\n2:52 o'clock -- Pulse 48 -- respiration 30.\n\n3 o'clock -- Visited again by Mrs. LINCOLN.\n\n3:25 o'clock -- Respiration 24 and regular.\n\n3:35 o'clock -- Prayer by Rev.

Field, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; Judge Otto, Assistant Secretary of the Interior; Gen. Halleck, Gen. Meigs, Senator Sumner, R.F. Andrews, of New-York; Gen. Todd, of Dacotah; John Hay, Private Secretary; Gov. Oglesby, of Illinois; Gen. Farnsworth, Mrs. and Miss Kenney, Miss Harris, Capt. Robert Lincoln, son of the President, and Doctors E.W. Abbott, R.E. Stone, C.D. Gatch, Neal Hall, and Mr. Lieberman. Secretary McCulloch remained with the President until about 5 o'clock, and Chief-Justice Chase, after several hours' attendance during the night, returned early this morning.\n\nImmediately after the President's death a Cabnet meeting was called by Secretary STANTON, and held in the room in which the corpse lay. Secretaries STANTON, WELLES and USHER, Postmaster-General DENNISON, and Attorney-General SPEED, were present. The results of the conference are as yet unknown.\n\nThe President's body was removed from the private residence opposite Ford's Theatre to the executive mansion this morning at 9:30 o'clock, in a hearse, and wrapped in the American flag. It was escorted by a small guard of cavalry, Gen. AUGUR and other military officers following on foot.\n\nA dense crowd accompanied the remains to the White House, where a military guard excluded the crowd, allowing none but persons of the household and personal friends of the deceased to enter the premises, Senator YATES and Representative FARNSWORTH being among the number admitted.\n\nThe body is being enbalmed, with a view to its removal to Illinois.\n\nFlags over the department and throughout the city are at half-mast. Scarcely any business is being transacted anywhere either on private or public account.\n\nOur citizens, without any preconcert whatever, are draping their premises with festoons of mourning.\n\nThe bells are tolling mournfully. All is the deepest gloom and sadness. Strong men weep in the streets. The griet is wide-spead and deep and in strange contrast to the joy so lately manifested over our recent military victories.\n\nThis is indeed a day of gloom.\n\nReports prevail that Mr. FREDERICK W. SEWARD, who was kindly assisting the nursing of Secretary SEWARD, received a stab in the back. His shoulder blade prevented the knife or dagger from penetrating into his body. The prospects are that he will recover.\n\nA report is circulated, repeated by almost everybody, that BOOTH was captured fifteen miles this side of Baltimore. If it be true, as asserted, that the War Department has received such information, it will doubtless be officially promulgated.\n\nThe government departments are closed by order, and will be draped with the usual emblems of mourning.\n\nThe roads leading to and from the city are guarded by the military, and the utmost circumspection is observed as to all attempting to enter or leave the city.\n\nAUTOPSY UPON THE BODY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\n\nAn autopsy was held this afternoon over the body of President LINCOLN by Surgeon-General BARNES and Dr. STONE, assisted by other eminent medical men.\n\nThe coffin is of mahogany, is covered with black cloth, and lined with lead, the latter also being covered white satin.\n\nA silver plate upon the coffin over the breast bears the following inscription:\n\nSIXTEENTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\n\nThe remains have been embalmed.\n\nA few locks of hair were removed from the Presiden's head for the family previous to the remains being placed in the coffin.",

        "instruction": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Laura Mitgang has written an honors thesis on Germaine Tailleferre at Oberlin College. By LAURA MITGANG PARIS Germaine Tailleferre, the only woman in the post-World War I group of young composers known as Les Six, and one of the two members who are still living, celebrated her 90th birthday last month. And shortly before that, the Paris Opera paid homage to her with a performance of her new ''Concerto de la Fidelite'' for high voice and orchestra. She continues to work, to play the piano, and to see old friends.\n\nLes Six resulted more from friendship than a doctrine but was nevertheless inspired by a general reaction against Impressionism. Promoted by Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie, the group helped celebrate a youthful French spirit that had suffered in the trenches during World War I.\n\nNot long ago, I spent a number of afternoons with Mme. Tailleferre in her modest apartment on Rue d'Assas where she lives with her granddaughter, two cats, and a dog. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, Mme. Tailleferre walks to the nearby Ecole Alsacienne where for five years she has improvised piano accompaniments for children's dance classes. But her primary activity remains composition. Asked about her work methods, she remembers with a malicious twinkle a story she once created for an arrogant critic who was inquiring where her ''inspiration'' came from: ''It has to be late at night,'' she mused, ''in a room with the windows open and a full moon. I wait until a big gust of wind comes and then I close the windows right away so that I can trap it! And then I write.''\n\nMore seriously, she later said, ''First I use my head - what sounds, what form to give, how to do it. Next I look for a theme at the piano. If I find one, I begin to work, to write it, and from then on I use the piano a lot. But not at the beginning. If the theme comes, things usually happen very quickly. In concertos, though, one may find a musical idea that works very well for the slow movement, and then write a poor beginning or finale. When there are three movements, there is always one that is better than the others.''\n\nAs we were talking, she often used one of her two upright pianos to punctuate recollections. With utmost pleasure and absorption, she played and sang a series of short songs that she is currently composing for children's voices. Their deliberate simplicity reflects an exuberant ripeness of style. Mme. Tailleferre apologized for her voice and her arthritic hands which were giving life to the new songs and to older works played from memory.\n\nMusic came naturally to Germaine Tailleferre. At the age of 5 she had written her first piano piece, a Schumannesque melody she has not forgotten. ''I still remember this piece because it was an event for me. I didn't know the notes; I played by ear. Later, I had a hard time at the Conservatoire because my teacher was very strict, all the more so because I had talent. She was right to teach me that music was not as easy as that.''\n\nNevertheless, she earned more first prizes for brilliant studies at the Conservatoire de Paris than her classmates and future colleagues Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger, and Georges Auric.\n\nMr. Auric, at the age of 83, is the only other living member of Les Six. In his spacious apartment off the Champs-Elysees, he recently explained, ''You know, when one has a label, it is very hard to take it off. We did not want to keep it, but the press, the articles, the public called us 'Les Six' and there was nothing to be done about it. Labels in concerts as an industry are very important. If you put a label on a can of Coca-Cola, it sells much better than if you do not.''\n\nGeorges Auric writes about music as well as composing it. In 1979, Editions Grasset published ''Quand J' Etais La ...'', a collection of his reminiscences. When we talked he chose his words carefully because, as he explained, he fears being misunderstood. He was pleased, however, to discuss one of his long-time friends.\n\n''She was always very independent, and I think that what she wrote when she was young, as what she writes now, is remarkable. It is music of Germaine Tailleferre. Obviously her vocabulary has not changed. But one can keep vocabulary and, with age, subtly transform what one writes to give it more weight, more gravity, more importance. And I think that her recent works, in that sense, are extraordinary.''\n\nDarius Milhaud's widow, Madeleine, still lives in her apartment on Boulevard de Clichy. Inscribed sketches by Dufy, Leger, and Picasso, photographs of Satie, and souvenirs from the Milhaud's voyages adorn the living room. Mme. Milhaud, who perfected her English when she and her husband lived in California, described Germaine Tailleferre as, ''a very informal woman, very simple, extremely skillful with her fingers, capable of doing anything - cooking, sewing, patchwork. She is a very surprising person, full of courage, of quality, of natural elegance.''",

Round-trip business class tickets frequently sell for $4,000. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines are all putting lie-flat beds on those routes.

And he worries that JetBlue will be unable to offset the loss of the 31 coach seats with higher-fare passengers.\n\n‘‘The real benefit of lie-flat seats comes on international routes,’’ Corridore said.\n\nThe move came a week after JetBlue reported dismal earnings. Its quarterly income fell by nearly one-third, missing Wall Street expectations, as maintenance and other costs climbed faster than revenue.\n\nThe 13-year-old airline had benefited over the past decade from new planes with lower maintenance costs and lower wages because of its young staff. Now, as it ages, those cost benefits are starting to erode.\n\nJetBlue can’t grow much more in New York, where take-off and landing slots are restricted. It has grown in Boston to become the city’s largest airline. But Boston lacks the population base for the airline to expand much more.

Mr. Irani is in Washington to argue at the State Department against such a move. Any contribution, Mr. Irani said, would finance only ''propaganda.''\n\n''Of the 14 or 15 detailed programs the I.P.D.C. has already proposed,'' Mr. Irani said, ''each one of them concerns itself with strengthening government news agencies. They call themselves news agencies, but they are in fact propaganda agencies and not one of them will help in any way to further our objectives of a free press working independent of government.'' No Comment by State Dept\n\nThe State Department declined to comment today on Mr. Irani's assertion that the United States was about to contribute money to the program. But State Department officials have said that no money from the United States would be contributed to projects that were found to be unacceptable by American standards.\n\nBeginning at a communications development program meeting in Acapulco next January and thereafter, United States delegates intend to examine each project individually, officials said.\n\nThe Reagan Administration has gone on record in support of an amendment to the State Department budget that calls for a cutoff of contributions to Unesco if that organization persists in any attempt to regulate the world's press.

        "instruction": "Released at last, after 14 1/2 months in captivity, the Americans who were taken hostage in Teheran are not quite home free. They face a difficult readjustment to freedom, judging by the experiences of other hostages and prisoners of war.\n\nSpeculation on the psychological aftermath for the hostages has been widespread over the last year. But psychiatrists and psychologists who have studied the reactions of hostages in other situations say it is difficult to anticipate how these hostages will react to their ordeal because so little is known about the conditions they have endured during their captivity. Moreover, the reactions that can be anticipated will be further complicated by differences in each hostage's personality and individual abilities to cope with the ordeal.\n\nThe scant available studies on past hostages' experiences suggest that the 52 coming out of Iran could experience humiliation, embarrassment, self-deprecation, nightmares, guilt, fear, family problems and physical and nervous disorders, as well as anger.\n\nAnd their anger might be intensified, the experts say, by resentment of America's commitment to the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi and by the fact that they were ill-prepared for the possibility of capture. Psychological Aid to Families\n\nThe several hundred members of the hostages' families, who have suffered from stress as they grappled with anger, anxiety, guilt and fantasies of reunion, have been advised on how to cope by mental health professionals, including some on a special State Department team.\n\nThe return of their loved ones is another stress for the families, albeit a happy one, the doctors say. The Government hopes to bring all the hostages and their families together at intervals over the coming months and years so that they will be together in positive circumstances to counter the stress of past gatherings of family members before the captives were released from Iran.\n\nA glimpse of what the hostages have endured was provided by Richard I. Queen of Lincolnville, Me., who was released July 11 because of an illness, later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis.\n\nMr. Queen, who was vice consul at the American Embassy in Teheran, said at the time of his release that the hostages were often moved from place to place but were not relentlessly propagandized or subjected to physical mistreatment. He also said that, after a twomonth period that was a ''bad time,'' he became used to life as a hostage and read a great deal. Ticker-Tape Parades Opposed\n\nOne of those concerned about the readjustment of the freed Americans, Dr. Herbert C. Modlin of The Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan., said he hoped that the nation would not celebrate the hostages' return with the ticker-tape parades and large celebrations typical of a hero's welcome. Lionizing the hostages, he feared, would again set them apart as being different.\n\nThe State Department's plans include welcoming ceremonies in Washington that are expected to last two or three days. Most of the freed hostages will then be granted a 30-day leave.\n\n''Of course, the nation has been involved in their fate for months,'' Dr. Modlin said. ''I don't discount that for a moment. The returning hero response is perfectly natural, but it would not be the best thing for them, considering the difficult psychological work they have ahead of them.'' Little Known About Conditions\n\nBrian Michael Jenkins of the Rand Corporation suggested that hostages often felt more bitterness about experiences they had after being released than while they were incarcerated. He studied 77 incidents of international terrorism that occurred between Jan. 1, 1968, and June 30, 1975. Of the 348 hostages taken in that time, 250 were released unharmed. Mr. Jenkins used interviews with 40 of them to prepare an unpublished report for the State Department and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\n''Much, in some cases most, of the former hostages' anxieties and bitterness are directed not toward the kidnapping itself but toward the post-release experience,'' Mr. Jenkins said, ''specifically the treatment they received after their release.\n\n''The former hostage feels that he has gone through an experience which no one, save perhaps another former hostage, can understand,'' he continued. ''The experience is frequently cataclysmic. It may change the hostage's outlook on life itself. Some hostages have undergone profound religious experiences or a deepening of religious faith.''\n\nMr. Jenkins added that embarrassment was common among hostages, while they were captives and afterward, and that feelings of guilt often arose from a sense of having ''collaborated'' with the captors more than was necessary for survival. Recognition May Be Expected\n\n''It appears in some cases that the former hostage is treated in much the same way as a rape victim,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''Both of them are told not to talk about it; the entire episode is to be swept away, kept in the closet. Both kinds of victims also tend to feel that they are on trial.''\n\nThe hostage who is kidnapped because he is a symbol of the United States Government might expect to get some official recognition for his experience, Mr. Jenkins has found.",

        "output": "Released at last, after 14 1/2 months in captivity, the Americans who were taken hostage in Teheran are not quite home free. They face a difficult readjustment to freedom, judging by the experiences of other hostages and prisoners of war.   Speculation on the psychological aftermath for the hostages has been widespread over the last year. But psychiatrists and psychologists who have studied the reactions of hostages in other situations say it is difficult to anticipate how these hostages will react to their ordeal because so little is known about the conditions they have endured during their captivity. Moreover, the reactions that can be anticipated will be further complicated by differences in each hostage's personality and individual abilities to cope with the ordeal.   The scant available studies on past hostages' experiences suggest that the 52 coming out of Iran could experience humiliation, embarrassment, self-deprecation, nightmares, guilt, fear, family problems and physical and nervous disorders, as well as anger."

Trichet last week said interest rates could rise next month.\n\nZapatero has offered truckers emergency credit and early retirement incentives but refuses to set minimum tariffs, saying they have to adapt to fierce competition in Spain and Europe.\n\nSmall Spanish truck operators are worst hit, while large hauliers have kept working. Strike leaders have dismissed government proposals and want price guarantees to stop large firms undercutting them.\n\nSpain's Development Ministry said it would present measures on Wednesday to take the sting out of fuel price rises, and saw a chance of reaching a deal with the truckers by midweek.",

        "instruction": "CHARLESTON, S.C.— In early 1860, James L. Petigru, an eccentric Charleston lawyer, passionately urged fellow aristocratic South Carolinians to remain in the Union, in part - he said in a much quoted aside - because the state was ''too small for a republic and too large for a lunatic asylum.'' According to Edmund Robinson, a young white attorney on the Charleston County School Board, Petigru was the ''one righteous man'' whose presence caused President Abraham Lincoln to spare the city from Gen. William T. Sherman's March to the Sea.\n\nSavannah's loss was clearly Charleston's gain. But under the port city's blocks and blocks of beautifully preserved colonial houses and mild, sunny weather lies yet another battle between Federal sovereignty and states' rights. Mr. Robinson, a collateral descendent of the city's aristocracy, and his wife believe that his son ''should be growing up, rubbing shoulders with kids of another race.'' But that, he says, ''is just not happening now,'' and will not, without Federal pressure. Only 53 percent of the 47,000 students in the county are black, almost half of them attend schools that are 95 percent black.\n\nLast week, to the unhappy surprise of South Carolinians expecting protection from the new prominence of Senator Strom Thurmond, busing's enemy, in Republican Washington, the Justice Department agreed with Mr. Robinson. The 47,000-pupil consolidated district's plan for desegregating the city and suburban schools, requested in December after 14 months of study, was inadequate, the Department said. A city-suburban school suit - only the second ever in a large metropolitan area - was filed.\n\nThe difficulty, if that is the right word, in integrating Charleston's schools is that it does not present the decaying, inner city environment that white middle-class parents fear. On the peninsula defined by the Cooper and Ashley Rivers, geography is also demography.\n\nIn sections where street names of thoroughfares running east to west (''below Broad'' or ''south of Calhoun'') are still clear delineators of class, white parents traditionally drive or bus their children to public schools. Increasingly, newer and younger white arrivals are ''gentrifying'' adjoining blocks, now pushing above Calhoun Street (it used to be called Boundary Street), toward wellestablished black neighborhoods, who depend on the public schools to educate their children. Meanwhile, institutions of higher education are flattening other residences to make way for new construction. Several large hotel and convention center projects in the area are also planned. According to the Rev. Cornelius L. Campbell Jr., a black minister who just completed eight years on the county school board, with the exception of several pockets of poverty in the northwest section of the peninsula, ''in the next 10 years you're not going to have any black families in the city of Charleston.''\n\nAll sides of the present dispute also agree that the surrounding suburban public schools of Charleston County are already reasonably well integrated, and that the few remaining racially homogeneous, geographically isolated schools could be easily desegregated through pairing. The longterm question is whether Charleston wants to preserve public education on the peninsula. Another parent of white children in District 20's public school, a grizzled veteran of educational infighting, recalls warning his allies several years ago, ''don't get bogged down in arguing about curriculum - watch the real estate market!'' -MARK I.

        "instruction": "The staff of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Comission said yesterday that it would fine Consolidated Edison $40,000 for not protecting workers from radiation at its Indian Point 2 nuclear plant.\n\nA spokesman for Con Edison, Larry Kleinman, acknowledged the failure and said that the company would pay the fine and that it had already taken steps to prevent a recurrence.\n\nThe commission staff found that Con Edison had failed to supervise employees of a contractor, Cleanco Industrial Services of New York, while they were working at the plant during a seven-month shutdown. This had resulted from a leak from the Hudson River into the reactor building.\n\nCoincidentally, the chief administrative law judge of the New York State Public Service Commission ruled on Wednesday that Con Edison should refund up to $40 million that it had billed consumers because of the shutdown, because the utility was at fault. Amount of Radiation Unknown\n\nThe amount of radiation received by the Cleanco workers cannot now be determined, according to the commission staff. On several occasions, the staff said in a statement, the workers had failed to carry radiation-measuring devices - called ''dosimeters'' - when they went into areas of the plant known to be radioactive, and had lied about the readings on the dosimeters when entering records of exposure on log sheets.\n\nOn several occasions, according to the staff, workers had failed to take required precautions when working on a cask used for shipping waste that was highly radioactive. The staff said that a worker standing three feet away from the cask would receive in four and a half minutes the maximum amount of radiation allowed per calendar quarter by the nuclear commission.\n\nRadiation doses on several occasions exceeded the maximum recordable by the dosimeters, the commission staff said. ''The most serious concern is that management control of the radiation protection program was not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that contractor personnel exposures would be maintained with in exposure limits,'' the staff said in a letter to the utility. 'Con Ed Is Responsible'\n\nThe nuclear commission has no authority over Cleanco, according to a spokesman, Karl Abraham, who added, ''Con Ed is responsible for everybody who walks through the gate - visitors, hired contractors, everybody.''\n\nAt Cleanco's headquarters, in Long Island City, Queens, a man who answered the phone last evening said that no one was available to comment.\n\nThe commission found the violations after it was tipped off by a Cleanco employee, Mr. Abraham said. Since the period under investigation - April through July of 1980 - Con Edison has instructed its workers who enforce radiation rules to pay closer attention to whether dosimeters are being worn, according to Mr. Kleinman, the company spokesman. He said that guards and contractors had also been reinstructed on radiation safety, and that other improvements had been made.\n\nHe called the violations ''willful or deliberate circumventing of rules by employees of the contractor.'' Con Edison Paid Fine in 1976\n\nCon Edison paid a $20,850 fine in September 1976 on charges that a worker had received more than three times the allowable limit of radiation per quarter because the utility failed to take proper precuations.\n\nMr. Kleinman said Con Edison would not respond to the finding of the administrative law judge, William J. Cowan, that the utility was at fault in the leak from the Hudson River because the Public Service Commission had not yet ruled on the matter.\n\nThe judge said that closer adherence to safety guidelines could have prevented the leak. Con Edison is appealing a $210,000 fine sought by the nuclear commission in connection with the leak.",

It will be fiscally responsible for a corporation that will function as a ''broker'' for nearly one-half million ambulatory-care visits a year, including all services provided by the hospitals' clinics and emergency rooms, as well as the private offices of affiliated doctors.\n\nAs part of this autonomous board's fiscal role, the corporation will make decisions about how to recruit and retain physicians, about affiliation agreements with the local hospitals and about contracts with a variety of vendors from whom it will purchase supplies and services. The A.C.N.C. will negotiate reimbursement rates and will monitor quality in the network and contracts with health-care providers. By reducing overhead and instituting programs such as joint competitive purchasing and shared services, there is also the possibility that the A.C.N.C. ultimately will reduce the cost of ambulatory care in our community.\n\nWe have supported the corporation from the start because we believe it represents a realistic approach to reversing the erosion of community-based private practices here without compromising freedom of choice for the patients. Access to routine medical care for all patients, including the medically indigent, would be assured.\n\nIn addition, the plan was designed to preclude any further overcrowding of our hospitals' clinics and emergency rooms while reducing the multi-million-dollar outpatient losses that have driven Jewish Memorial to the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nNaturally, Presbyterian Hospital -by far the largest provider of ambulatory services in this area - has played a key role in the development of the A.C.N.C. proposal. However, the fact remains that all trustees, including those from the other hospitals and the community participants, will shoulder a considerable amount of responsiblity as board members. EDWARD H.

Say a venue has space for 10 trucks plus a half, we can now be that half.”\n\nWith a larger manufacturer now offering vans, Case noted the benefits of having a new vehicle with better power and mileage. “Also, if you have a problem, it means you can now take it to the dealer.”\n\nThe Nissan NV, released in the U.S. this summer, is its first commercial vehicle in the U.S. market. The three models (NV1500, 2500 and 3500) offer a standard or high-top roof and a V-6 or V-8 engine. Features include chrome bumpers, cargo area worklights, eight-way power driver’s seat, Bluetooth system and upgraded audio systems. Base prices range from $24,950 for a standard-roof NV1500 to $30,150 for a high-roof NV3500\n\n“It’s a unique product for us,” said Mark Perry, Nissan’s director of product planning. “This is really all about innovation, to have a little fun, because there’s been really nothing for this industry.”\n\nPerry noted that in this category, contractors have had a few choices, like GM, Ford, Dodge: “All well-established,” he said, “but older technology.”\n\nThe NV also provides an outfitting service—building and installing up to 60 square feet of graphics, designed by the buyer, on the vehicle.\n\n\"It’s cool, futuristic-looking. Right now, our trucks are more a nod to the past – vintage,\" said Case. “It really shows that the food truck industry is here to stay and expand.\"\n\nThe food truck craze has been taking off in recent years, revived by the gourmet trend. The L.A. Times reported in May that Americans are expected to spend $630 million on food this year from mobile vendors, according to the National Restaurant Assn. That's up from $608 million in 2010.\n\n“We’re currently in four cities, but having a larger manufacturer like this really would enable us to have consistency across the country,” Case said. “Rather than hoping for the best with a local purchase.\"\n\n“It brings a legitimacy to the food truck industry that we’re starving for.”\n\nHyundai takes the wraps off its new Azera\n\nFord to unveil new Fusion in Detroit in January\n\nXTS demonstrates Cadillac's embrace of a brave new world",

        "instruction": "Like many aspects of life in rural Alaska, putting on a football game is tough work. Until recently, though, some communities didn't realize just how much the games were costing school districts.\n\nIn Ketchikan, which is settled on a chain of islands in southeast Alaska, persuading opposing teams to make the long, difficult trek for a road game is much easier said than done. And unlike schools in most other states, away games aren't required to be played, since such a requirement would place some schools under significant economic strain.\n\nBut without opponents, Ketchikan can't play a football season. The school board's solution: Paying opponents to defray travel costs.\n\nThe issue came to light at a recent school board meeting, where football players revealed that one of their home games was in jeopardy, according to KRBD radio. The opponent, Seward, was wanting to cancel their trip to Ketchikan after the city allegedly reneged on an $8,000 payment to cover Seward's travel.\n\nIn the end, Ketchikan paid $8,700 to Seward, and the game was saved. But some in the community don't feel the reward was worth the cost.\n\n\"I’m confused and somewhat dumbfounded about our school district paying for travel for other communities to come here,\" said one Ketchikan residentat a recent city meeting.\n\nThe superintendent replied that, without paying schools to travel, Ketchikan would never have opponents to play in football.\n\nTravel to Ketchikan is so expensive because it is an \"off the road\" school, meaning opponents cannot travel by car or bus. Only plane and, in Ketchikan's case, boat are available as travel options.\n\nThis is why Alaska's governing body for high school sports does not mandate that opponents play scheduled games. Similar quandaries are found throughout the state in places like Nome and Barrow, the latter of which spent $44,000 to host four football games in one season.\n\nOne solution in the works is a state-wide funding pool to cover travel expenses for communities in hard-to-reach areas. But barring its approval, Ketchikan has to decide how much a home football game is worth.\n\nLike us on facebook, follow us on twitter, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nA mustache is perfect way to distract people from looking at the helmet-induced red spot on his forehead.\n\nThis look could have made his musical commercials for DirecTV even better.\n\nHe did play a bad guy of sorts in his United Way spot on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nFu Manchu for the king? None so far, but LeBron has made surprising decisions in the past.\n\nFor all the attention his receding hairline receives, maybe James would prefer a little lipular distraction.\n\nHe didn't need this to cast himself as a villain. But how much better would it have been if he did The Decision with this look?\n\nSomehow he'd still be a hit with the ladies.\n\nPerhaps this would be a nice experiment for his retirement.\n\nConsider this our retirement gift.\n\nSomething tells us Gisele wouldn't go for this.\n\nBrady wouldn't be the first quarterback to don a bushy stache, but his pretty boy image would certainly take a hit.\n\nUnless he's angling for 'Most Interesting Man in the World,' though, Brady's probably better off sticking to his round-the-clock 5 o'clock shadow.\n\nMaybe the reason this look seems to fit is that it aligns with Kobe's intense personality.\n\nDespite the career-long comparisons with MJ, Kobe never went for the mustache like his predecessor.\n\nGiven Bryant's frustration with his declining game, this old-fashioned approach to facial fashion probably wouldn't serve his interests.\n\nHe still looks like a recent college grad.\n\nCombine this and with his pink-eye glasses from the Olympics for an even more memorable look.\n\nA mustache like Sam Elliott, but none of the affinity for guns.\n\nTony Romo has taken enough abuse over the years. He doesn't need to do this to himself.\n\nThis might be a look Romo could pull off. Fans in Texas certainly wouldn't argue.\n\nMaybe this style can be revisited once he wins a playoff game. A stache like that is something you earn.\n\nChalk this up as more fodder for the legions of hecklers he faces every season.\n\nGiven his West Point pedigree and regimented ways, Coach K just doesn't seem like someone who would go this route.\n\nDid this get girlfriend Lindsey Vonn's approval?\n\nAlthough it has a nice throwback vibe, Tiger's always been a clean-shaven man.\n\nThe time spent waxing the tips would be better used to work on his short game.\n\nGoing outside looking like this would seal Saban's villain status.\n\nHey, is that Dave Wannstedt, minus the on-field mediocrity?\n\nThis is kinder than what fans from other SEC schools have done.\n\nWell, he did tattoo his face.\n\n\"I can feel it coming in the air tonight ...\"\n\nFor a man that trains pigeons, it's just crazy enough to work.\n\nEqually as bad as the cut-off hoodies he won't give up.\n\nThis feels like we're infringing on Mike Ditka territory.\n\nIf Ulysses S. Grant were a 21st-century football coach...\n\nSomething he picked up in Florida, from the looks of things.\n\nThis does give an intriguing edge to an otherwise unthreatening man.\n\nIn his post-NFL days, maybe this is the safest way to get attention.\n\nFalls in line with Jerry's philosophy of doing whatever he wants, no matter what you think.\n\nThis is a better look than him nagging Jason Garrett on the sidelines.\n\nMaybe this paints Jones as a caricature, but it's a pretty accurate one, no?\n\nAs his foothold at the top loosens, Nadal needs every advantage he can get.\n\nThirty years ago, this would have made perfect sense.\n\nThis look is even less popular in Spain, Nadal's native country.\n\nThe Spurs coach should try a different look each time he does a sideline interview.\n\nPopovich received intelligence training at the Air Force Academy, and disguises are part of the routine for spies.\n\nIn addition to winning five NBA titles, Popovich has been named coach of the year three times.\n\nSince he hasn't gotten much playing time, a mustache could be another way to work his way back into the headlines.\n\nManziel is no stranger to lounges and other after-dark hot spots.\n\nBefitting Manziel's Texas roots, this makes some sense. But how does it affect his branding?\n\nFew athletes have a head so precisely sculpted as Ronaldo. This doesn't fit.\n\nA stache like this would have fit well in this summer's World Cup, when a last-second assist from Ronaldo helped Portugal tie the U.S.\n\nComical as it may be, don't expect this look from the 2013 FIFA Player of the Year.\n\nThe man loves entertaining, but this may be too much.\n\nPerhaps his friend Bill Cowher taught him a thing or two about intimidating facial hair.\n\nIf Gruden does jump back into coaching after this season, this would be a bad first imrpession.\n\nHey, in professional wrestling, when does anything cross the line?\n\nQuite frankly, if Flair wants to make a splash, this might be a little too conservative.\n\nIt makes no sense, and it's not a good luck. But hey, it worked for Hulk Hogan.\n\nIf Barkley's way of talking were a style of facial hair, this would be it.\n\nBarkley wore a stache proudly in his younger playing days, but it hasn't been seen in many years.\n\nToday, Barkley seems happiest when he's ruffling feathers, so maybe this throwback look would do what he wants.\n\nIf Rory wants to separate himself from the rest of his golf peers, this would do it.\n\nAfter breaking off his engagement to Caroline Wozniacki, it wouldn't be surprising to see him embrace mini rebellions like unorthodox facial hair.\n\nMaybe Ben Hogan would applaud this look, but modern golf fans would likely disapprove.\n\nHockey doesn't get much TV viewership these days, but maybe this could help turn around that trend.\n\nIf there's any sport where this mustache belongs, it's in the NHL.\n\nCrosby is targeted enough by other teams as it is -- no need to ask for it.\n\nIf Jim Harbaugh is really on his way out after this season, a stunt like this certainly couldn't hurt.\n\nPerhaps Jim's trying to channel Jeff Fisher's consistent calm via mustache.\n\nA mustache like the Monopoly guy, but he still buys his khakis at Wal-Mart.\n\nWatt was a hockey player growing up so he should be familiar with playoff beards.\n\nWatt started his college career as a tight end at Central Michigan.\n\nThen he transferred to Wisconsin and swtiched to defense.\n\nThe Manning men haven't really pulled off facial hair, historically speaking. Eli is no exception.\n\nIf the Giants continue their slide, this might be a good way to fool passersby on the New York City streets.\n\nHe was a fiery coach, but in retirement Parcells is trying to channel his inner Buddhist. At least that's what this look suggests.\n\nThe mustache has adorned many a football man over the years, but Parcells has always preferred a clean-shaven look.\n\nParcells picked this up during his inglorious time as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nIt hurts to look at, but with two Super Bowl rings, Tom Coughlin has earned a long leash.\n\nBack-to-back underwhelming seasons have Coughlin playing the role of villain in New York.\n\nTom loves gun-slinging as much as the next guy, but without a running game, that's been a tough sell for the Giants.\n\nIf he knew it would give him an edge in recruiting, Calipari might shave his head.\n\nCalipari has gone to the Final Four with three schools: UMass, Memphis and Kentucky.\n\nWhile coach of the New Jersey Nets, Calipari got into hot water for calling Star-Ledger reporter Dan Garcia a \"----ing Mexican idiot.\"\n\nThe Panthers owner reportedly isn't a big fan of \"alternative\" fashions, and this one probably applies.\n\nNewton's got a cannon for the Wild West -- he threw for 400 yards in his first NFL game.\n\nWhile this is a fine look, it's one Newton hasn't embraced thus far in his young career.\n\nNothing's as bad as the recent scandals that have hit Goodell.\n\nGiven the chance, many NFL fans would paint Goodell's mug with far less savory images.\n\nThe NFL commish's penchant for expanding the league's bottom-line has made him a villain in many eyes.\n\nPerhaps Brees is hoping to distract from the hairy birthmark on his cheekbone.\n\nBrees has never been much of a mustache guy, going all the way back to his playing days at Purdue.\n\nNow, Brees is one of the league's most prolific passers -- but that isn't helping his team, which is just 3-5 to start 2014.\n\nHow would this play at Augusta?\n\nGiven that Nantz has been clean-shaven for his entire career, this style twist presents quite the change in direction.\n\nNantz's voice is regularly featured giving play-by-play for both the NFL and televised golf.\n\nBerman has played himself in movies including the 2005 remake of The Longest Yard, but maybe this could have enhanced his appearance.\n\nHe once performed with Huey Lewis.\n\nDid you know Boomer was a history major at Brown University?\n\nNo matter what the look, chances are good that Wilson can wrangle an endorsement out of it.\n\nAfter Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III, two other quarterbacks -- Brock Osweiler and Brandon Weeden -- were selected in the 2012 NFL draft before Wilson.\n\nWilson was also drafted in baseball by the Orioles out of high school and the Rockies in college.\n\nHe attended Ohio State as an undergraduate and received an honorary doctorate.\n\nThe first of his record 18 majors championships was the 1962 U.S. Open.\n\nHis 18th and final major victory was the 1986 Masters, which he won as a 46-year-old.\n\nSelig was a commissioner willing to take chances with the addition of the wild-card playoff teams, interleague play and awarding home-field advantage in the World Series to the league that won the All-Star Game.\n\nBut he was also in charge while PEDs took over the game.\n\nSelig brought baseball back to Milwaukee by buying and moving the Seattle Pilots in 1972. The Braves had left Milwaukee for Atlanta in 1965.\n\nWith the retirement of Bud Selig, Bettman has seniority among the commissioners in the four major sports.\n\nBefore becoming NHL commissioner, Bettman was an NBA executive who helped develop the salary-cap system.\n\nWith three lockouts and a full season lost to his credit, Bettman won't win many popularity contests.\n\nHere's an easy way to get them to stop talking about your eyebrows.\n\nIn 2012, Davis won an NCAA championship and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nHe finished second to Damian Lillard of Portland in voting for 2013 NBA rookie of the year.\n\nBradshaw and Joe Montana are the only quarterbacks to go 4-0 in Super Bowls.\n\nDid you know Bradshaw had a role in the movie \"The Cannonball Run\"?\n\nBradshaw was the first overall pick in the 1970 draft.\n\nLolo Jones Discusses 'Bobsled Butt'",

Dearie, a candidate for City Comptroller, yesterday attacked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's plans to contribute approximately $2.5 million toward running two upstate commuter lines whose costs had been primarily borne by the New Jersey Transportation Corporation.\n\nAccording to Mr. Dearie, the M.T.A.'s previous payment to Conrail for the lines had been $328,000 annually. Some of the money would be used to lease rail cars and locomotives from the New Jersey Transit system; the rest would be used for operating expenses and for extending a line from Monroe to Middletown.\n\nNew Jersey Transit, forcing the issue, has reduced payments to Conrail for the Hoboken to Port Jervis line and the Pascack Valley line, saying Conrail should collect the money from the M.T.A. New Contract Terms\n\nOperating costs on those lines were raised substantially in July 1980 when Conrail renegotiated its contract with the New Jersey Transit Authority.\n\nMr. Dearie said in a statement: ''With subways and New York State commuter rail cars unair-conditioned and buses that are literally falling apart as they rattle through New York City's streets, it is unconscionable for M.T.A. to consider giving a tenfold increase to New Jersey before taking care of its own dilapidated system.''\n\nArthur G.

Who's going to provide the service?''\n\nMr. Perfall pointed out that both Rockland and Orange County residents are paying new M.T.A. taxes to subsidize mass transit. ''Part of our mandate is to provide service for all of these counties, not just for the subways,'' he said. ''We can't very well close down the service up there and use all the money for the subways.''\n\nThe $2.5 million cost, said Mr. Perfall, would be small when compared with the M.T.A.'s overall budget of $2.5 billion. He added that the amount would barely have been noticed if applied to subway improvements.\n\n''He's straining awfully hard to find an issue,'' Mr. Perfall said.",

While Komisarjevsky has blamed his co-defendant for killing the family, prosecutors said Komisarjevsky was the leader.\n\nJurors deliberated for about four hours and will resume on Thursday.\n\nA judge denied an effort Wednesday by Komisarjevsky's attorneys to reopen their defense based on letters from co-defendant Steven Hayes claiming he had committed numerous murders in the past. They cited letters from Hayes saying he killed 17 people in the Northeast and committed dozens of drugged date rapes. A prosecutor called the letters unreliable.\n\nAuthorities say Komisarjevsky and Hayes broke into a home in Cheshire, Conn., in 2007, beat Dr. William Petit with a bat, tied him and his family up and forced his wife to withdraw money from a bank. The house was doused in gas and set on fire, leading to the girls' deaths from smoke inhalation.\n\nHayes was convicted last year of raping and strangling Jennifer Hawke-Petit and killing her daughters. In his case, jurors deliberated for about five hours over two days before finding him guilty. He is on death row.\n\nKomisarjevsky's trial began Sept. 19 and featured grim evidence, including rope used to bind the family and autopsy photos.\n\nAfter a little more than an hour of deliberations, jurors sent the judge a note asking, \"When giving the verdict, do we need to specify if we have found him guilty as a principal or an accessory?\"\n\nJudge Jon Blue said jurors don't have to specify and that if they find him guilty of a charge, they don't need to be unanimous on whether they believe he's an accessory or principal.\n\nBlue denied a motion for a mistrial by Komisarjevsky's attorneys, who said a prosecution expert sitting close to jurors rolled her eyes seven times in disbelief during defense closing arguments. Blue did call jurors out from the deliberations room to caution them that any facial expressions by spectators are not evidence and should be disregarded.\n\nThe letters came to light just before closing arguments Tuesday in New Haven Superior Court. Komisarjevsky's attorneys say the letters could help their arguments that Hayes orchestrated the crime.\n\nBut Blue said the claims were not corroborated and would actually hurt Komisarjevsky's case because of claims Hayes makes in the letters about the Connecticut crime. Testimony is reopened to avoid miscarriages of justice, he said.\n\nHayes' claims, if true, would make him one of the worst serial killers in American history. But Blue said the claims were vague, with no dates, locations or other details.\n\n\"It certainly means there is no real corroboration of this,\" he said.\n\nSpokesmen for the FBI and Connecticut state police declined to comment Wednesday on whether their agencies are looking into Hayes' murder and rape claims. The state Department of Correction declined a request by The Associated Press to release copies of Hayes' letters, citing Blue's gag order in the case.\n\nThe judge said Hayes would only invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination if called to testify. He said the letters blame Komisarjevsky for much of the home invasion.\n\n\"This would be the seal of Mr. Komisarjevsky's doom,\" Blue said.\n\nHe also denied a defense motion for a mistrial based on comments prosecutors made during closing arguments.\n\nAssociated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report.",

She argues that individual caloric requirements established by F.A.O./W.H.O. ''are based on the needs of Americans and Europeans'' and ''food needs vary from person to person by as much as 50 percent.''\n\nThe situation is even more complicated.\n\nFirst, to the best of my knowledge, F.A.O./W.H.O. have not published the empirical studies from which the requirements were derived. There were perhaps a few such studies, but even these would have had to be based on small samples of individuals.\n\nSecond, in addition to variations between individuals, there is the fact, emphasized by the Indian biostatistician Sukhatme, that the same individual is found to vary his food intakes substantially while remaining in good health and maintaining body weight. Sukhatme has shown that making some allowance for these two sources of variation reduces the estimate of extent of undernutrition in India's population from 50 percent to 25 percent or less.\n\nExaggerating the extent of undernutrition has the unfortunate effect of making the already difficult problem appear insoluble and, worse still, focuses attention on indequate food intakes as the cause of morbidity while in fact gastrointestinal diseases resulting from the intake of polluted water and from poor sanitation are perhaps equally important causes.

        "instruction": "A DOZEN children, each one accompanied by a parent, sat on carpeted steps in the program room of the Westport Public Library on a recent Sunday afternoon, listening as 9-year-old Carey Chiaia outlined the story of the book ''Ben and Me'', by Robert Lawson.\n\nWithout a note and without hesitation, Carey described every scene in the story: how Amos, a poor, hungry mouse, left his family to look for work, found food and shelter in the Philadelphia home of Benjamin Franklin, became his trusted friend and assisted in all of his inventions -- leaving out nothing, or so it seemed to a visitor who had read the book the night before.\n\nApplause greeted the end of the presentation, and then a lively dialogue took off, with children and parents commenting on the book and a moderator, Lawrence Goldstone, drawing the children into a discussion of biography versus fiction, the use of words like objective and subjective, how to determine truth and other subjects, both weighty and humorous.\n\nNobody thought the part about the mouse could be real. Mice, no matter how smart, can't write a book, they all agreed.\n\n''But do you all agree that the part about Benjamin Franklin was real?'' asked Mr. Goldstone.\n\n''Well, one part was not real,'' answered one girl. ''He did not go to France.''\n\n''He did too go to France,'' shot back a boy. ''I read all about it in a book on the Revolutionary War.''\n\nIt was the second meeting of a Parent and Child Book Group, a new series of programs presented by the Friends of the Westport Library, where most of the activities are aimed at adults.\n\n''We wanted to offer some family-oriented programs,'' said Faith Taylor, who was recently elected president of the Friends. ''We were looking at what the library offered school-age children, and our feeling was that the library has traditionally done well for very young kids, but school-age kids are not interested in little kids' activities.''\n\nSo a committee made up of Ms. Taylor, the board members Mary Beall Mooney and Nancy Goldstone and Mrs. Goldstone's husband, Larrence, met with the children's librarian, Kitty Lyons, to discuss possibilities. They talked with teachers, parents and children and came up with the concept of a parent-child book discussion group for 7-, 8- and 9-year-olds, which would meet once a month throughout the school year.\n\n''It seemed a perfect activity for a library,'' Ms. Lyons said, ''and it seemed doable. The five of us sat down and had some heated debates about what books to choose, then we made a flier and sent it out to the schools, to the second, third and fourth grades. The response was incredible.''\n\n''We had decided to organize two groups and keep them fairly small, 15 parent-and-child pairs at the most,'' said Ms. Mooney, a professional artist who is a chairwoman of the committee with a writer, Nancy Goldstone. ''Within three days, all the spaces were filled and Karen Wingate, one of the parents who called to sign up, volunteered to head up a third group.''\n\nNow the program involves one group of 8- and 9-year-olds and two younger groups, and many parents have volunteered to lead some of the sessions while others have offered to provide the (indispensable) snacks.\n\nEach moderator decides how to present the book under discussion. Before the first meeting of their group, for example, Ms. Mooney and her daughter Galen, 8, read Oliver Butterworth's ''Enormous Egg'' to each other and then came up with 25 questions they put in a hat and passed around, so each participant could have a topic to talk about. ''We call it a book club,'' Ms. Mooney said, ''and I want to see the club members involved. I want to see all the kids speak, but it must be their choice. I don't want them to feel intimidated.''\n\n''Basil of Baker Street,'' a popular mystery written by Eve Titus, was the title chosen for a meeting of a younger group, a session planned by the mother-daughter team of Susannah and Alexandra Bailin. Alexandra had thought up numerous questions that the children answered in writing. Then she devised a guessing game that involved the participants sitting on the floor with the name of one of the book's characters taped to their back.\n\nThey discussed some of the unfamiliar words in the story and looked them up in the dictionary. ''Evildoer'' was tossed around with appropriate grimaces and everyone agreed that ''scurried'' was the perfect way to describe a mouse's gait.\n\nThey capped the meeting with an earnest evaluation of the book: one did not like it because of all the hard words; one did because mysteries are fun; another was pleased that the characters were animals rather than humans.\n\n''I get a lot of feedback from both parents and children,'' said Ms. Mooney, ''I call them after each meeting and ask what they liked and didn't like. I believe in empowering children; anything you can do to encourage them to have their say is wonderful.''\n\n''People love the groups,'' she continued. ''One Mom said that her son told her to hurry up, he didn't want to miss any of the discussion. And another said that because of the session on ''Ben and Me,'' her family had decided to go to Philadelphia during spring break to learn more about Franklin and his times.''\n\nMr. Goldstone, a writer and book collector, reported that at his most recent session several couples had accompanied their child.\n\n''At first, that was taboo,'' he said, explaining that only one parent was supposed to attend. ''But when both are showing up because they want to participate, and you're looking to generate enthusiasm, it's hard to say 'go home.' As long as the fathers don't overdo the snacking!'' he added.\n\nHis own enthusiasm for the program led him to volunteer to teach a creative-writing class for middle school students, and one class quickly became two.\n\n''I did not realize the involvement would become so intense, but I am thrilled,'' said Mr. Goldstone, who says he teaches writing to seventh and eighth graders ''the same way I taught adults at N.Y.U.''\n\n''I shoot high,'' he says of the way he runs a meeting. The next session, for example, will be devoted to the poetry of Shel Silverstein, but Mr. Goldstone has decided to add Robert Frost's ''The Road Not Taken''.\n\n''Will the kids recognize the theme of being different?'' he asked, as he spoke of the ''thirst that kids have for exploring ideas.''\n\nBuoyed by the program's success, the organizing committee plans to expand the groups to six by next year.\n\n''The more it spreads throughout the town, the better it is,'' said Mr. Goldstone. ''We want all kids and parents to discover what a joy it is to read books. We're hoping that every family will become a microcosmic book group.''\n\nPhotos: Carey Chiaia, 9, and Lawrence Goldstone, above, make a book presentation at the Westport Public Library.

        "instruction": "NORWICH, Conn.— Edward L. Davis Jr., a construction worker in Hazelton, Pa., used to have to replace his glass-lined thermos every month. That was until he tried a steel-lined container and one day left it on the outrigger of a 50-ton hydraulic crane.\n\n''The thermos got jammed between one edge of the outrigger and the frame of the crane,'' he recalled. ''It crushed a little on the side, but it still worked. I couldn't believe it. Just about everyone I work with has a stainless steel one now.''\n\nThe growing popularity of steel bottles is just one change remaking the thermos industry, which is also contending with rising competition from automatic coffee makers and vending machines in the work place.\n\nThe move away from the glass thermos, long a standard in lunch boxes, has forced the Thermos Company of Norwich, Conn., which introduced the thermos bottle to this country 77 years ago, to shut down its glass-making operation in the Laurel Hill section of town earlier this month and consolidate the unit's operations with a plant in the Taftville section. Another glass plant in Macomb, Ill., was closed this summer.\n\nAt a time when most thermos companies buy their glass from suppliers such as the GTE Corporation and the Corning Glass Works, Thermos was one of the last to make its own. The company will continue to assemble glass-lined thermoses, but will now buy its glass from Thermos U.K., a sister company in Britain. Both are units of Household International Inc., of Prospect Heights, Ill.\n\nAccording to Thermos, while it will continue to make glass models, it will now stress steel and plastic containers. The all-plastic market has grown in recent years out of concern about using glass in children's thermoses. The polyurethane does not insulate as well, but it costs less, and it can keep milk cold enough.\n\nIn addition to rubbing shoulders with jelly sandwiches in children's lunchboxes, many of today's thermoses are carried by blue-collar workers, hikers and campers, and other outdoors enthusiasts.\n\nSteel thermos bottles retail for $20 to $35, as opposed to their glass or plastic counterparts, which retail for well under $10. But many customers seem willing to pay a premium for the added durability.\n\nSteel bottles typically carry a five- year to a lifetime guarantee. And if the letters the manufacturers say they get are to believed, the bottles have been run over by tractors, fallen from six-story buildings, plunged into the depths of the Snake River - and still delivered on their promise to keep hot coffee hot, or cold drinks cold.\n\nBut Thermos and its competitors, such as Aladdin Industries of Nashville and Union Manufacturing of Meriden, Conn., are plagued by a problem that goes deeper than what bottles are made of: theirs is a mature industry with a basic product that can be little improved on.\n\n''Every year the demand drops by large amounts,'' said Norman St. Jean, a spokesman for Thermos. The market loss is especially strong among white-collar workers, and is evident even in the company's own headquarters. ''I don't know any execs here who carry a thermos to work,'' Mr. St. Jean said. ''Most people go to coffee machines.''\n\nThe thermos is a victim of its own success. According to Haynes W. Kelly, president of Thermos, half the nation's households already own at least two thermos bottles. So how do you sell someone a third?\n\n''We think you can,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''if you do something to improve the bottle.'' He pointed to the various flip tops and spouts that now grace many styles of thermos.\n\nBut real product improvement is harder. The basic design has changed little since the English invented the vacuum flask in 1892. Typically, one bottle is sealed within another, and the air is removed from between them. A silver finish between the outer sleeve and the core provides some insulation, but the vacuum is the most effective component. Glass is a better insulator than other linings, but much less durable.\n\nAt its peak, Thermos made as many as 15 million vacuum bottles a year. That level continued for some time after the company lost its exclusive trademark in 1962, and the word thermos entered the general vocabulary. But while the company declines to say how many it produces today, the heyday is long over.\n\nIn an effort to retrench, about a year ago the company's management decided to consolidate its production. It also cut costs and revamped its marketing. Thermos enlivened its packaging with color and illustration, overhauled its sales force and started an ambitious $3.5 million push for its newest product: the Coffee Butler, a glass-lined carafe more suitable for a dinner table than its unshapely predecessor.\n\nPart of the consolidation was the the closing of the Laurel Hill plant, an event that saddened many Norwich residents.\n\nThe company has occupied its current site along the Thames River in eastern Connecticut since 1913. That was when William B. Walker, who founded Thermos's forerunner, the American Thermos Bottling Company in 1907, moved there from Brooklyn. He chose Norwich partly because of its rail service and active seaport, and partly because the town gave him the property.\n\nThe deal stipulated that Mr. Walker spend three times the deed's $250,000 value in national advertising and wages, which he did in three years. For years, Thermos was the town's largest employer, with 120 workers in the Laurel Hill plant and 500 in another site five miles away in the Taftville part of town.\n\nJerome Theve, one of 72 Thermos employees moving to the Taftville site - most of the 48 other employees have taken early retirement - said he would miss the round-the-clock glass operations at Laurel Hill.\n\n12 Minutes to Make a Thermos\n\nHe remembers, for instance, that it took 12 minutes to make a thermos from start to finish, half the time it took when he joined the company 22 years ago. He can also trace the four- mile circuit that a glass lining made through the plant before it could be made into a thermos. And when the day came to close the 71-year-old building, Mr. Theve was sentimental. ''The Thermos was the very heart of Norwich,'' he said.\n\nBut the cutbacks may be paying off. Frank J. Barkocy, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said the company has made progress. ''Net sales and revenues for 1983 were modestly below 1982 levels, but operating profits and net income were up sharply,'' he noted.\n\nThe Consumer Products division of Household International, of which Thermos is the major part, reported revenues of $123.7 million in 1983, down a bit from $124.8 million in 1982. But net income rose to $7.4 million, from $5.4 million.\n\nThere is one area of the industry apparently insulated from market erosion. The back-to-school lunch kit thermos has been a steady performer, ever since Aladdin put Hopalong Cassidy on one of its kits in 1950. The industry discovered that a frequent change of motifs - from Mr. T. to the Smurfs - insures that kids change lunch boxes - and their coordinated thermoses - yearly.",

Both are privately financed nonprofit organizations.\n\nOther concerns represented included the General Electric Company, Honeywell Inc., the Caterpillar Tractor Company, Pepsico Inc., the J. C. Penney Company, the Consolidated Edison Company, the Atlantic Richfield Company, Philip Morris Inc., the American Express Company, Avon Products Inc., the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and several large insurance companies. Discovered by Accident\n\nSome executives reported that they had accidentally discovered the value of their retired workers when, in desperation, they called on them for help in dealing with a mountain of work that had suddenly piled up. The executives said it proved to be more economical to have their own experienced former employees handle the extra work on a part-time or temporary basis than to call in outsiders with no background in the company.\n\nAs a result, one company surveyed its retired employees, found that a high percentage would like to return for part-time or temporary work, and now sends information about available jobs with its pension checks.\n\nSome conference participants were astonished to find that other companies had obtained Internal Revenue Service approval for such programs and vowed to seek the same approval.\n\nA key question was whether the companies could work out such parttime employment programs so that a recalled retiree could keep his or her tax-free Social Security pension. Union representatives questioned the effect part-time and temporary workers would have on collective bargaining and the hiring of new full-time workers. Company representatives also raised the issue of whether recalled retirees were entitled to health benefits and worker compensation.\n\n''Older workers'' are defined as anyone over 40 years old, the age at which discrimination is barred by law. The symposium dealt mostly with workers over 55, the age when many begin to take early retirement. ''A healthy 50-year-old worker has 20 years of work life ahead,'' one speaker said.\n\nThe conferees recommended that management begin at least 10 years ahead of time to prepare workers for retirement by offering counseling and training for other careers. They also called on management, labor, government and other organizations to share information about changing attitudes, values and needs of today's healthier older workers and suggested they identify and eliminate practices that have impeded retention and hiring of older workers.\n\nAt a general meeting summing up one day's workshop discussions, Jerome M. Rosow, president of the Work in America Institute, predicted, ''Society in the next century will be begging for older workers - there won't be anyone but older workers, they may have to pay them a premium to keep them from retiring.'' The baby boom of the 1960's was followed by a declining birth rate, he said, which will result in a labor force consisting of 60 percent older workers by the year 2,000.",

Google does not release separate figures for mobile and desktop ad revenues.\n\nPaid clicks on advertisements increased 17 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago and 2 percent from the second quarter.

The rally was staged to test the recently restored freedoms of assembly and expression in the Philippines and to protest what the demonstrators call United States approval of Philippine human rights policies.\n\nIn a ''people's trial,'' both President Ferdinand E. Marcos and the United States were found guilty of human rights violations against the Filipino people. ''We did not come here to celebrate'' said Jose B. L. Reyes, a former justice of the Supreme Court. ''Human rights is a myth in our country.''\n\nThe United States was given no defense. A large figure of Uncle Sam had only one line to deliver - the toast made by Vice President Bush at the re-inauguration of Mr. Marcos this year: ''We love your adherence to democratic principles and democratic processes.'' Signs of Growing Tolerance\n\nSuch large church-sanctioned protests have become more common in the Philippines since martial law was lifted Jan. 17. Although protesters say abuses of their freedoms have not decreased since January, there have been signs of a growing tolerance of criticism and dissent.\n\nUnions, once prohibited by law from striking, have become increasingly active, and strikes have been occurring at the rate of one a day. Students, considered the strength of the opposition, have been given new rights of expression and assembly and the freedom to publish student newspapers. Incidents of bugging and student harassment have supposedly been stopped. A bill introduced last week would outlaw police interference in any legitimate student activity and ban infiltration of student groups.\n\nSlowly, the press has begun to test the limits of its new freedom to criticize the Government, even though self-censorship has prevented personal criticism of either Mr. Marcos or his wife, Imelda. Nevertheless, in a gesture of good will, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile encouraged the press to expose all corruption, including scandals in the military. ''My office will be the first to protect you against intimidation from any performance of your legitimate journalistic duties,'' he said.\n\nMinister of Labor Blas F. Ople has called for public accountability for Philippine agencies and institutions. The Development Bank of the Philippines, he said, ''routinely escapes presidential and legislative surveillance and remains fairly immune from public scrutiny.'' U.S. to Support Loans\n\nSuch moves have earned the Philippines a passing mark from the Reagan Administration, which recently announced that it would support badly needed loans to the Philippines from development institutions such as the World Bank.",

The compounding pharmacy produced tainted pain injections that have sickened more than 700 people across the country and killed 53 others.\n\nThe wave of infections was first identified in September and grew into one of the deadliest medication-related outbreaks in US history. New England Compounding halted operations in October and faces more than 100 lawsuits in federal court.\n\nBut more than half a year later, lawmakers in Washington continue to debate whether the public health crisis could have been prevented.\n\nRepublicans on the House subcommittee investigating the outbreak said that the FDA should have closed New England Compounding based on complaints from doctors, patients, hospitals, and drug distributors. The FDA first inspected the pharmacy in 2002 and issued a warning letter in 2006 for mass-producing copies of manufactured drugs. Beginning in 2007 and continuing through 2012 the FDA continued to receive complaints about the company from anonymous informants and state pharmacy regulators, according to internal documents released by the committee.\n\n‘‘Ten years of warning signs, alarm bells, and flashing red lights were deliberately ignored,’’ said Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Murphy and other Republicans point to correspondence in thousands of pages of FDA documents turned over to the committee.\n\nFDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg reiterated Tuesday that her agency needs clearer authority to go after the compounding industry, which has challenged the FDA’s authority in court since the 1990s.\n\nIn testimony, Hamburg said the agency is working to crack down on compounding pharmacies, despite conflicting laws and court decisions that govern the space.\n\n‘‘I wish we had been more aggressive, and I can assure you that we are being more aggressive now,’’ Hamburg said.\n\nRepublicans pressured Hamburg to explain a 2011 FDA decision to suspend routine inspections of compounding pharmacies. Hamburg said agency lawyers recommended halting enforcement due to legal questions about the agency’s authority to police compounding pharmacies. Hamburg told lawmakers she was unaware of the policy at the time.\n\n‘‘I regret that I was not more fully aware,’’ Hamburg said.\n\nCompounders mix customized medications based on doctors’ prescriptions, and have traditionally been overseen by state pharmacy boards. But in recent years, the FDA has tried to police larger compounders, which operate more like manufacturers by mass producing drugs and shipping them across state lines.\n\nLast week the FDA completed a wave of inspections targeting about 30 compounding pharmacies with a history of complaints or problems. Inspectors reported finding a host of potential safety hazards, including rust and mold in supposedly sterile rooms.\n\nRepublicans charged that this ‘‘flurry of well-publicized activity’’ only proves that FDA has the ability to shut down pharmacies like New England Compounding.\n\n‘‘No law has changed. The only change is the FDA decided to act,’’ Murphy said.\n\nCongressional Democrats acknowledged that the FDA did not act quickly enough to prevent the outbreak, but placed the blame on a complicated legal landscape.\n\n‘‘Basic flaws in the compounding law and a series of conflicting court decisions have created uncertainty and confusion,’’ said Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, ‘‘As a result, FDA was unable to develop a coherent policy.’’\n\nWaxman and other Democrats said Congress should pass new laws to clarify FDA’s authority.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, June 21— The chairman of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation has expressed strong doubts about the need for plants that produce natural gas, raising new fears that the Government may reduce its support for the fledgling industry.\n\nEdward E. Noble, who took office a month ago, met last week with officials of the American Natural Resources Company, which is now building the Great Plains Coal Gasification project in North Dakota. He told them that he was concerned that the gas from what would be the nation's first modern-day commercial synthetic fuels plant would cost too much and might not be needed.\n\nMr. Noble would not comment directly on accounts of these talks but they were confirmed by a spokesman for the Synthetic Fuels Corporation.\n\n''Right now he's got real serious questions about it,'' the spokesman declared. Mr. Noble's objections might not be sufficient to kill the Great Plains project, on which work began last summer, since the necessary Federal loan guarantee of up to $2.02 billion could be provided by the Department of Energy.\n\nBut they were regarded by Congressional and other sources as evidence that Mr. Noble may be moving aggressively to severely limit overall Government support for synthetic fuels. Report Said to Urge Termination\n\nMr. Noble was the Oklahoma businessman who led the Reagan Administration's transition team for synthetic fuels, whose report is said to have recommended that the corporation be terminated.\n\nThe Synthetic Fuels Corporation was created under a law signed by President Carter last June. It was intended to spur creation of an industry that could produce the synthetic fuels equivalent of 500,000 barrels of oil a day by 1987.\n\nIt has gotten off to a very slow start, however, and the oil surplus that emerged this spring has now further reduced the sense of urgency that once surrounded the synthetic fuels goals.\n\nSome Congressional sources say that they think Mr. Noble, in seeking to affect a project like Great Plains that does not, and might never, come under his jurisdiction, is on a ''mission'' to carry out the recommendations of the transition team.\n\n''He's parachuting into the stadium and saying 'stop the game,' '' one staff aide asserted. ''It's quite offensive.'' When asked about this, the corporation's spokesman said, ''It is true that it is his goal to get the job done and go out of business.'' But he added that if this were taken to mean this would be done in, say, six months or a year, that would be ''an inaccurate interpretation.'' Supporters Mount Defense\n\nMeanwhile, political supporters of synthetic fuels have mounted a defense centered on the confirmation proceedings for Synthetic Fuel Corporation board members.\n\nMr. Noble is said to have been pushing to have the White House declare his body fully operational, despite the fact that the other six board members are not yet in place. President Reagan has named five candidates but their formal nominations have not yet reached the Senate.\n\nAccording to a source involved in the confirmation process, James A. McClure, the Idaho Republican who heads the Senate Energy Committee, has told the Administration that the committee was in effect holding the rest of the board hostage until agreement on corporation policy can be reached.\n\nAmong the prospective board members are Victor A. Schroeder, one of Mr. Noble's best friends, and V.M. Thompson Jr., his banker. The problem-plagued Great Plains project, for which planning began in the early 1970's, now appears to be the vehicle for a showdown over policy.\n\nDepartment of Energy approval of the Great Plains loan guarantee, which Energy Secretary James B. Edwards has repeatedly said he supported, would be regarded by many as a rebuke to Mr. Noble. Senior presidential aides are said to have told Mr. Edwards the decision is his. D.O.E. Might Administer\n\nIf granted, the loan guarantee would probably remain within the department to be administered, since it could not be transferred to the Synthetic Fuels Corporation unless the corporation voted to accept the project for its portfolio.\n\nAmerican Natural Resources, caught in the political crossfire, now says that unless the guarantee is approved soon it might have to scrub the project in which it has $65 million already at risk.\n\n''After nine years of effort we have finally reached the starting gate,'' a company spokesman said late last week. But a decision has to be made by month's end, he indicated, if another building season is not to slip by, thereby escalating costs still further.\n\n''It's not a matter of weeks anymore,'' said the spokesman for American Natural Resources, which has set similar deadlines on previous occasions. ''We're talking about days.''",

The Web-based software fills merchants in on what’s selling and what’s not and can help sellers avoid overinvesting in inventory, McLean-Foreman said. It can also make suggestions for optimal pricing on different items and help with accounting and shipping. Subscriptions to the software start at $2,500 per month.\n\nSome retailers may worry about losing control of their brand or their customers by selling through Amazon. But, McLean-Foreman said, “our vision is that you are in a game where you need to position inventory through someone like Amazon, because that is where all the customers are.”\n\nAnd because of features like Amazon Prime second-day shipping, credit cards on file, and wish lists, “transactions with Amazon are extremely frictionless,” he said.\n\nMike Dreese, the chief executive of Newbury Comics, said about 30 percent of the Boston company’s revenue comes from online sales, primarily through Amazon — a share that is growing quickly.

Tina Johnson, 14, and her stepfather desperately swam after little Christie Terlizzi when she was swept away by the wake of a boat during a fishing trip in Great Kills Park around 12:40 p.\n\nm., police said. Both would-be rescuers were quickly pulled beneath the waves by a vicious undertow. A passing boater plucked little Christie and her father from the water, but Tina drowned. \"When I heard my granddaughter died, I blacked out,\" said William Blanchard, clutching framed pictures of the two girls outside the family's three-story Staten Island home. After learning of the death of their oldest daughter, the parents were keeping vigil by Christie's hospital bed at Staten Island University Hospital, where she was in critical condition last night. The father, Richard Terlizzi, also was treated at the hospital but was not admitted. Leaning against a fence, Blanchard said Tina tried her best to save her little sister. \"Tina loved floating around in the water,\" he said. \"That's what she was doing when this happened.\n\n\" Neighbor Mary Malak said the rescue was typical of Tina. \"She's not a good girl, she's a great girl,\" said Malak. \"She's got a great heart.\n\n\" The tragedy marred what had started as a happy family day. The family's four children - Tina, Christie and two boys, Vincent, 11, and Richard, 9 - were looking forward to spending a whole day with their father, a butcher who usually works long hours. Vincent and Richard couldn't stop talking about the trip at their neighbors' house the night before. \"They were all excited about going fishing,\" said Mary Malak. \"They were excited to spend the day with their dad.\n\n\" The family was fishing off the rocks when the fun day quickly turned to terror. Christie was paddling in the water with the help of a flotation device and Tina was swimming nearby when a large boat rumbled by, Blanchard said. The giant boat, identified by harbor unit police as the Atlantis Princess, sent a large wake at the two sisters and knocked the floatie off Christie. Before anyone could blink, the little girl was dragged out to sea. Terrified at the sight of the wave swamping her sister, Tina started swimming after her. Their desperate dad quickly plunged into the water and followed them. But the swift current pulled them all away from the shore. After a passing boater managed to rescue Richard Terlizzi and tiny Christie, dozens of harbor unit officers flooded the scene in search of Tina. But no one could find the missing teenager for an agonizing hour. \"She's such a considerate girl,\" said Malak. \"She's always taking care of her brothers and sister.\n\n\" A crowd of 20 heartbroken friends and relatives gathered last night outside the family's home in the shadow of the Bayonne Bridge last night after a wrenching day at the hospital. \"She was my best friend,\" sobbed Dina Malak.",

Apple is undisputedly licensed to these patent and the Apple App Makers are protected by that license. There is no basis for Lodsys’ infringement allegations against Apple’s App Makers. Apple intends to share this letter and the information set out herein with its App Makers and is fully prepared to defend Apple’s license rights.\n\nBecause I believe that your letters are based on a fundamental misapprehension regarding Apple’s license and the way Apple’s products work, I expect that the additional information set out below will be sufficient for you to withdraw your outstanding threats to the App Makers and cease and desist from any further threats to Apple’s customers and partners.\n\nFirst, Apple is licensed to all four of the patents in the Lodsys portfolio. As Lodsys itself advertises on its website, “Apple is licensed for its nameplate products and services.” See http://www.lodsys.com/blog.html (emphasis in original). Under its license, Apple is entitled to offer these licensed products and services to its customers and business partners, who, in turn, have the right to use them.\n\nSecond, while we are not privy to all of Lodsys’s infringement contentions because you have chosen to send letters to Apple’s App Makers rather than to Apple itself, our understanding based on the letters we have reviewed is that Lodsys’s infringement allegations against Apple’s App Makers rest on Apple products and services covered by the license. These Apple products and services are offered by Apple to the App Makers to enable them to interact with the users of Apple products—such as the iPad, iPhone, iPod touch and the Apple iOS operating system—through the use or Apple’s App Store, Apple Software Development Kits, and Apple Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) and Apple servers and other hardware.\n\nThe illustrative infringement theory articulated by Lodsys in the letters we have reviewed under Claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 7,222,078 is based on App Makers’ use of such licensed Apple products and services. Claim 1 claims a user interface that allows two-way local interaction with the user and elicits user feedback. Under your reading of the claim as set out in your letters, the allegedly infringing acts require the use of Apple APIs to provide two-way communication, the transmission of an Apple ID and other services to permit access for the user to the App store, and the use of Apple’s hardware, iOS, and servers.\n\nClaim 1 also claims a memory that stores the results of the user interaction and a communication element to carry those results to a central location. Once again, Apple provides, under the infringement theories set out in your letters, the physical memory in which user feedback is stored and, just as importantly, the APIs that allow transmission of that user feedback to and from the App Store, over an Apple server, using Apple hardware and software. Indeed, in the notice letters to App Makers that we have been privy to, Lodsys itself relies on screenshots of the App Store to purportedly meet this claim element.\n\nFinally, claim 1 claims a component that manages the results from different users and collects those results at the central location. As above, in the notice letters we have seen, Lodsys uses screenshots that expressly identify the App Store as the entity that purportedly collects and manages the results of these user interactions at a central location.\n\nThus, the technology that is targeted in your notice letters is technology that Apple is expressly licensed under the Lodsys patents to offer to Apple’s App Makers. These licensed products and services enable Apple’s App Makers to communicate with end users through the use of Apple’s own licensed hardware, software, APIs, memory, servers, and interfaces, including Apple’s App Store. Because Apple is licensed under Lodsys’ patents to offer such technology to its App Makers, the App Makers are entitled to use this technology free from any infringement claims by Lodsys.\n\nThrough its threatened infringement claims against users of Apple’s licensed technology, Lodsys is invoking patent law to control the post-sale use of these licensed products and methods. Because Lodsys’s threats are based on the purchase or use of Apple products and services licensed under the Agreement, and because those Apple products and services, under the reading articulated in your letters, entirely or substantially embody each of Lodsys’s patents, Lodsys’s threatened claims are barred by the doctrines of patent exhaustion and first sale. As the Supreme Court has made clear, “[t]he authorized sale of an article that substantially embodies a patent exhausts the patent holder’s rights and prevents the patent holder from invoking patent law to control postsale use of the article.” Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Elecs., Inc., 553 U.S. 617 (2008).\n\nTherefore, Apple requests that Lodsys immediately withdraw all notice letters sent to Apple App Makers and cease its false assertions that the App Makers’ use of licensed Apple products and services in any way constitute infringement of any Lodsys patent.\n\nBruce Sewell Senior Vice President & General Counsel Apple Inc.",

        "instruction": "Facebook may not listen to CalSTRS.\n\nThe California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) is the nation’s second-largest public pension, with around $145 billion in assets under management. So when it speaks, companies tend to listen.\n\nBut I’m not so sure that Facebook will be among those willing to sit at E.F. Teacher’s knee.\n\nCalSTRS reportedly is concerned with certain corporate governance provisions Facebook disclosed last week in its IPO filing, including those related to preemptive restrictions on proxy battles or hostile takeover attempts.\n\nHere is how Janice Hester-Amey, a portfolio manager in CalSTRS Corporate Governance unit, explained it to Reuters: “No matter how brilliant you are, when you come to the public market — not that we want to ever tell Zuckerberg or anyone like him how to run his company — there should be some protection especially for long-term, patient money like CalSTRS.”\n\nHester-Amey added that CalSTRS has invested in Facebook via private equity funds and is expecting to invest in the social network’s publicly-traded shares.\n\nIf CalSTRS has any leverage with Facebook, it would have to be in that prospective purchase of publicly-traded shares, because its private equity investment is virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe pension system declined to discuss specifics (citing confidentiality), but Fortune has learned that its sole private equity exposure is through commitments to funds managed by Technology Crossover Ventures. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm did not invest in Facebook directly, but rather purchased shares on the secondary market from earlier backers like Accel Partners.\n\nAccording to Bambi Francisco, TCV paid around $144 million to acquire Facebook common and preferred shares in 2010, via several transactions. My assumption is that the deals were done out of Technology Crossover Ventures VII, a $3 billion fund raised in late 2007. CalSTRS committed $200 million to that vehicle, which represents around a 6.67% stake. That means its total investment in Facebook works out to only around $9.6 million.\n\nThe value of those shares has obviously fluctuated in the intervening time, but not necessarily in the pension system’s favor. Francisco reported that TCV bought common shares at $45 a piece, compared to a recent secondary trading price of $40 per share. Even if Facebook hit a $100 billion valuation through IPO — the high end of an estimated $75 billion to $100 billion range — that still would put them at just about break-even. And its overall ownership percentage is three lengthy decimal points away from single digits.\n\n[Update: A CalSTRS spokesman now says that the system had $30 million of exposure to Facebook as of June 30, 2011. He would not get more specific, but I remain certain that it’s only through TCV. Either the $30 million reflects a mark-up through Q2 of last year, or that TCV bought even more shares after Francisco’s article. Either way, $30 million represents just .03% of Facebook’s anticipated $100 billion valuation]\n\n[Update II: A TCV spokesperson says the firm holds around a 1% stake in Facebook.]\n\nMoreover, TCV is only mentioned once in Facebook’s entire IPO filing: A section in which TCV is listed among several existing shareholders would have “agreed to vote all of their shares as directed by, and granted an irrevocable proxy to, Mr. Zuckerberg at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders.”\n\nDid you catch the irony? CalSTRS is worried that Zuckerberg has too much power, at the expense of long-term shareholders like CalSTRS. But part of Zuckerberg’s control was facilitated by TCV, which is the firm through which CalSTRS first invested (and, theoretically, should hold more effective sway). That’s right: CalSTRS, by virtue of being a limited partner with TCV, was technically a party to the capitulation.\n\nLook, it’s entirely possible that Facebook will hear CalSTRS out, because doing so is a quick and easy way to appease corporate governance advocates. But it won’t be pressured into making any changes, because CalSTRS doesn’t have enough shares to matter.\n\nGet my daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com",

        "instruction": "Greeting visitors from her chair in the marbled lobby of the Pierpont Morgan Library the other night, 96-year-old Lady Wodehouse might almost have been one of the nice rich aunts out of a novel by her late husband.\n\nA stranger would bend over to shake her hand. Then her grandson, Edward Cazalet - a barrister who had come over from London for the occasion -would lean down and announce the visitor's name. At last, likely as not, Lady Wodehouse, after a pleasant ''hullo'' and a look through milky blue eyes, would yank the formally dressed guest down to her level and impart a great smacking kiss on the cheek. It was a bit startling.\n\nThe occasion Thursday night was the 100th birthday of P.G. Wodehouse - pronounced ''woodhouse'' in the accent of the writer's ancestral Norfolk.\n\nThe Morgan mounted an exhibit of Wodehouse books, lyrics and memorabilia; let 180 people spend $250 each to see the show before it opened yesterday to the public; provided them with shrimp and drinks amid the splendor of the library's books, dinner in the carved Meeting Room upstairs and (a first for the library) a one-man cabaret by a West Ender named Edward Duke. The Celebrations Abound\n\nMr. Duke ran about in manic or subdued imitation of such Wodehouse characters as the hollow-headed Bertie Wooster and his Spinoza-reading valet, Jeeves.\n\nThere are similar events to honor the writer's centenary on both sides of the Atlantic. The British Museum has a Wodehouse exhibition, and a recent film festival in London featured some of the 35 movies that Wodehouse worked on.\n\nHis English public school - Dulwich, which took his books off its shelves during World War II after he broadcast from his out-ofprison internment in Berlin that he was being treated well - has now named its library after him. Other quiet Wodehouse festivals are planned for Toronto and San Francisco.\n\nThe Wodehouses lived in Remsenburg, L.I., after 1951 but the author's American connections began with a first visit in 1904. He met and married Ethel Rowley in New York City in 1914, and, besides his novels and stories, he wrote dialogue in Hollywood and collaborated in musical comedies (usually as lyricist) with Jerome Kern and Guy Bolton. One of Wodehouse's most famous songs, ''My Bill,'' which found its way into ''Show Boat,'' is often assumed to be somebody else's.\n\n''Remember this,'' a Wodehouse buff from London named Barry Phelps said yesterday. ''He's one of the few authors who has about 70 books still in print. He still has 60 books in print in Italian.''\n\nMany of Wodehouse's 100 novels and innumerable short stories have been translated into two dozen other languages. More than 30 million Wodehouse books have been sold since his first was published in 1902. And he kept knocking them out daily until his death in 1975. A Purity of Prose\n\nIn a talk at the Morgan Library yesterday, Frances Donaldson - author of a profile of Evelyn Waugh and a biography of Edward VIII, and who has recently done a Wodehouse biography to be published by Knopf next spring - attributed her subject's astonishing popularity to his prose style as well as his humor.\n\nReaders and fellow-writers, including George Orwell, one of many who defended Wodehouse against the charge of Nazi sympathies, have claimed that he had one of the purest ways with words in modern English -and, of course, that the silly characters he created out of his Edwardian youth could be terribly funny:\n\n''Tell me Adams, have I eaten my cheese?'' ''Not yet, your Lordship. I was about to send the waiter for it. ''Never mind. Tell him to bring the bill instead. I remember that I have an appointment. I must not be late.'' ''Shall I take the fork, your Lordship?'' ''The fork?'' ''Your Lordship has inadvertently put a fork in your coat pocket.'' The rich and the not-so-rich, the intellectual and the not-so, all paying their respects at the Morgan, admitted helplessly that scenes like that were capable of hurling them them from their beds with laughter.\n\nIt was a trans-Atlatic crowd. Other Britons included Jacob Rothschild; Iain Sproat, author of ''Wodehouse at War''; Richard Usborne, a Wodehouse scholar who will give a talk at the Morgan next Wednesday, and the British Ambassadors to Washington and the United Nations. Among the Americans were C. Douglas Dillon, former Secretary of the Treasury, and Isaac Asimov, a writer even more prolific than Wodehouse.\n\nMr. Asimov resisted the comparison. ''Quantity, yes. But, ah, without the quality.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Lady Wodehouse photo of Wodehouse's book covers photo of Edward Duke as Jeeves",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 26— With his far-reaching initiative for shifting Federal programs to the states, President Reagan has signaled his determination to press forward with ''the Reagan revolution'' in government and has moved to try to dominate the legislative agenda in the face of recession and a restless election-year Congress. In a State of the Union Message that culmin ated weeks of internal debate, Mr. Reagan overruled the White House staff and economic advisers who urged him to combat ballooning F ederal deficits by increasing excise taxes. And he took the risk that later this year Congress would see deficits as its top priori ty and try to take the political initiative from him.\n\nTacitly, by changing his emphasis from the budget and tax cutting battles of 1981 to what he calls his ''new federalism,'' the President was adapting to the economic reality that he could not produce ''a quick fix'' for the economy and the political reality that Congressional majorities would probably balk at another round of huge budget cuts. Allies and foes alike saw his initiative as an effort to divert attention from the projected budget deficits of nearly $100 billion in this fiscal year.\n\nIn his 45-minute address, Mr. Reagan returned to his inuagural theme that his primary personal mission was to slow the growth of Federal spending and reduce the size of the Federal Government, and emphasized that the economic downturn had not shaken his faith in tax-cut, supply-side economics. 'I Don't Believe We Should'\n\nHe seemed to be answering his own inner circle firmly and forcefully when he declared: ''The doubters would have us turn back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax-rate reductions already passed by this Congress. Raise present taxes to cut future deficits, they tell us. Well, I don't believe we should buy their argument.''\n\nThat stirred no applause from the Congressional audience. Nor did his warning to advocates of tax increases that this approach would not lower deficits or balance the budget but would only slow economic growth, reduce production and destroy future jobs.\n\nThe applause finally came when he asserted that he would ''seek no new tax increases this year,'' though later he qualified this by proposing that Congress close tax loopholes and tighten the minimum business tax. His aides estimate that would yield $31 billion in tax revenues in 1983 and 1984.\n\nQuite purposefully, however, the President exhorted the public to be patient with his economic recovery program despite the recession and he sought to throw the political spotlight on his proposal to turn over $47 billion in 40 Federal programs to the states.\n\nGiven the tough economic situation and the partisan m ood in Congress, the President's political strategists calculate that this is the best w ay for Mr. Reagan to sustain political momentum after his first yea r.\n\n''This represents the fifth installment on the President's mandate,'' James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, said. ''Last year, he cut spending, he cut taxes, he cut regulations and he strengthened defense. The fifth thing he wanted to do was return power to the states. This fundamental realignment of the Federal system is a dramatic and bold initiative, and I think it's going to allow us to dominate the debate.'' Michel Cites an Election Year\n\nBut an immediate omen came from the House Republican leader, Robert M. Michel of Illinois. While backing the President's proposal, he noted that it did not directly address the nation's economic plight in an election year.\n\n''This is right in line with Republican dogma,'' Mr. Michel said, ''but my enthusiasm has to be muted a bit because it doesn't create one new job now. It's a partial answer to the long-range problem but it does not do anything for the immediate problem.''\n\nNot only Republican Congressional leaders but even White House officials concede that, as Congress approaches early votes on raising the debt ceiling or adopting a 1983 budget resolution, the deficit issue could take precedence and touch off bipartisan efforts to cut military spending or raise taxes.\n\nBoth moderate Northern ''gypsy moth'' Republicans such as Representative Bill Green of Manhattan and conservative Southern ''boll weevil'' Democrats like Representative G.V. Montgomery of Mississippi forecast pressure on the President to cut military spending to restrain deficits.\n\n''I see some signs that Republicans in both House and Senate might work with Democrats if the problem of the deficits and interest rates is not addressed head-on,'' said Representative James R. Jones of Oklahoma, the House Budget Committee chairman. They Saw Little Alternative\n\nPresidential aides conceded that Mr. Reagan might have more problems dominating the political arena this year than last but decided that they had little alternative but to come up with a series of initiatives with the ''new federalism'' as the centerpiece, to gain the upper hand politically. ''I think we can hold the initiative this y ear,'' one White House official, said. ''We're not naive. It's going to be tough. But we think we can get a good portion of this progr am passed. And if we hadgone up there with just more budget cuts, we would lose the momentum in five days.''\n\nBut the ''new federalism'' package faces a long, arduous legislative fight, especially with Democrats in a partisan mood, as they indicated in their prepackaged, nationally televised critique of Mr. Reagan tonight. Because it touches many programs, it will have to be approved by a host of Congressional committees and is likely to take up most of the year's session.\n\nWorried about the impact on New York, Mr. Green said that Congress would have to insure that the tax revenues Mr. Reagan was turning over to the states would grow as rapidly as the programs that are being turned over and also that Northern states would not be hurt by having other states adopt lower standards for programs like food stamps and welfare.\n\nRecalling the comment by David A. Stockman, the budget director, that the 1981 Reagan tax program was ''a Trojan Horse'' for traditional Republican economics, Mr. Green said: ''If Stockman put together this gift horse for the states, we will want to look at it in the teeth very closely.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of President and Mrs. Reagan 027-20-42",

He had the top few floors. A wonderful guy.\"\n\nToboul was accustomed to photographers trailing Al-Fayed, Princess Diana's wealthy boyfriend.\n\n\"All the time, they want to know who's inside the car, but that's what tinted glass is for,\" Toboul said. \"They never see anything in my car. And I never say anything.\"\n\n\"Three people dead over a bulls--t picture?\" said Phil Hart, a retired New York City cop, shaking his head. \"If two motorcycles got in front of me while I was driving, I'd take them right out. You've got to protect your passengers. Afterward, I'd say, I thought they were terrorists or kidnapers.\"\n\nFor 36 hours, the world knew nothing about the driver of the Mercedes in Paris.\n\nNo name. No obituary. Just a commoner playing a small role in a royal tragedy.\n\nBut that has all changed now. His name is Henri Paul, 41. He was not Dodi's usual driver, but the No. 2 security person at the Al-Fayed family's Ritz Hotel. The regular driver had taken off in a decoy vehicle moments before Dodi and Diana's Mercedes-Benzleft the hotel.\n\nPaul, we are now told, was legally drunk. He was racing at more than 120 mph.\n\nDespite the latest revelations, James Marshall, a chauffeur from Washington, refused to jump to conclusions.\n\n\"As a driver, you don't know who was on those motorcycles, what they were intending to do,\" Marshall said. \"Maybe he [Paul] was told, 'Quick, get us out of this situation.' Maybe something happened to the car. We should wait and get all the information.\"\n\nAt the St. Regis Hotel, just off Fifth Ave., chauffeur Bobby Robinson sat in his limo. \"A professional driver wouldn't have put himself in that situation,\" he said. \"Why would a guy be going that fast unless it was something he couldn't control? And if you have a regular driver you trust, why let someone else stay with you? Where's the logic? I don't think everything's come out.\"\n\nJose Malan has been driving VIPs for nearly 25 years. When the Shah of Iran was ousted in 1979 and came here for medical treatment, Malan chauffeured him in an armor-plated Mercedes. Reporters hounded the shah's every move.\n\n\"The media, they're like spies,\" Malan said. \"They hide in bathrooms, everywhere. They used to ask me all the time if I knew where the shah's properties were. I know what you know, I tell them.\"\n\nLike all the other drivers, Malan could not understand why Paul would have raced through Paris, especially if he'd been drinking.\n\n\"Some people with money think they have the power to order you to do anything,\" Malan said. \"I've had passengers who want to get to the airport in 15 minutes. I tell them, 'If you're in a hurry, take a helicopter, 'cause I don't want to die.' Or I tell them, 'You take the keys and I'll sit in the backseat.' \"\n\nAt this point, we don't know exactly what happened. But for Henri Paul, the commoner, it would have been unthinkable to tell the glamorous princess and the son of his billionaire boss that he would not drive 120 mph in the middle of a city to escape scurvy paparazzi after a big score.\n\nAs in all tragedies, though, this is really more about loss than about blame.\n\nIN THE FANTASY realm of kings and queens and dukes and duchesses, gentle Diana moved beyond the dissolute society ghosts wandering about the globe with no palpable purpose and touched everyday people.\n\n\"With all her charity work for the poor, everyone learned from her how to be a celebrity,\" Toboul said.",

Among other complaints, he has criticized instances of nudity during performances over the last three years.\n\nLast June, before the Durham City Council voted to appropriate $40,000 for the festival, the Rev. Jerry Hooper asked at a council meeting: ''How many of you are going to be righteous and how many are going to be wicked on this issue? That's my message from the Lord for you tonight.''\n\nThe current drive has had mixed results so far. Thomas Campbell, a bookstore proprietor who is running in the upcoming primary for the Ward No. 1 seat, said he would support continued funds for the festival. Letters to Newspapers\n\n''Whenever someone says he knows God's will and I don't,'' Mr. Campbell said, ''I tend to think he doesn't know what he's talking about.''\n\nLast season a work called ''Pass'' by choreographer Johanna Boyce, part of the American Dance Festival's ''Emerging Generation'' series, provoked a number of angry letters to various newspapers complaining of male and female nudity. Although ''Pass'' received enthusiastic reviews around the state and nationally, an editorial in The Durham Morning Herald called the nude scene ''a necessary risk.''\n\nIn 1980, a Republican candidate for the State Legislature in Raleigh called a performance of the modern-dance group Pilobolus in which there was partial nudity ''filthy'' and ''obscene'' and demanded that the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources withdraw its own $50,000 grant to the festival.\n\nOfficials and supporters of the American Dance Festival are especially concerned about Mr. Hooper's campaign, despite the fact that the $40,000 represents a small fraction of the festival's overall budget. They cite significant cuts in the Federal Government's financing of the National Endowment for the Arts and a greater competition for private individual and corporate philanthropy.\n\nCharles Reinhart, president of the festival, noted that at the time the festival agreed to move from Connecticut to North Carolina in 1978, ''we were told we wouldn't have to worry about our artistic license.''",

        "instruction": "Diamonds may still be a girl's best friend, but they have proven to be unfaithful companions for investors and dealers in recent months.\n\nAfter soaring last February, the wholesale price of diamonds fell steeply last spring and has continued to drop steadily this winter. Since September, according to Martin Rapaport, author of a monthly report on wholesale diamond prices, prices have fallen by nearly 11 percent, including a drop of 6 percent in the last month alone.\n\nThe tumbling diamond prices have not yet reached the consumer, but they are taking their toll among the people who buy and sell precious stones. On New York's 47th Street, which is usually lined with people haggling over fistfuls of precious stones, dealer enthusiasm has waned as have the number of deals. While many of the long-time residents of the street refuse to discuss the matter - there is a general fear that mention of falling diamond prices will further the decline - others admit that times have rarely been so hard.\n\n''If prices fall any further, I might just close for two weeks and 'take inventory,''' said Hertze Hasenfeld of Hasenfeld-Stein, a leading dealer and cutter. Cut in Consumer Demand\n\nThe price of diamonds, like gold, has come under a number of economic pressures. As interest rates have soared, wealthy private individuals, who had begun to invest in diamonds and other tangibles as inflation hedges, have switched to the money markets.\n\nAt the same time, consumers have been buying fewer, and smaller, diamond jewels. Although Christmas sales exceeded gloomy forecasts, according to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that markets 85 percent of the world's diamonds, there was no increase in the number of pieces sold.\n\nDepressed by soft demand, prices of investment-grade diamonds have dropped precipitously. A one-carat flawless stone that might have fetched $65,000 or more at wholesale early last year is now selling for $52,000, or less, according to Eli Izhakoff, chairman of the Diamond Dealers Club. Prices have also fallen for the smaller stones used in jewelry, although not as steeply. Only industrial diamonds have been unaffected by the weak market.\n\nBecause jewelers order at least six months in advance, the slump in diamond prices has not yet been felt at the retail level, according to Willis Cowlishaw, jewelry marketing group vice president for Zale's, the nation's largest jeweler. He added, however, ''If wholesale prices stay down, we should be able to pass the savings on to our customers this spring.''\n\nBut a consumer rush to buy diamonds, if it materializes at all, will come too late for some members of the industry. The diamond recession has taken its greatest toll among the dealers and cutters in Israel, who concentrate on the smaller stones. Wholesale prices plunged there first, leading to a rash of bankruptcies. Waiting for Prices to Rise\n\nThere have been fewer casualties on 47th Street, where companies tend to be older and better-capitalized. For many of those diamond cutters and dealers, the favored strategy seems to be based on a siege mentality. The dealers -who in the cloistered world of 47th Street sometimes appear to be endlessly trading diamonds back and forth among themselves - are buying little and selling less, preferring to wait for prices to rise.\n\nBecause of the curious nature of the diamond industry and its governing monopoly, De Beers, a wait-and-see strategy may be the only one to adopt. Through its Central Selling Organization, De Beers sells its rough diamonds to a select list of 300 clients around the world, at ''sights,'' or selling sessions where boxes of diamonds change hands. Sights are held 10 times each year in London and the system allows De Beers to prevent wild price swings by controlling initial price and supply.\n\nWhen diamond prices are falling, however, the privilege of buying from De Beers can become onerous. While sightholders can theoretically limit their allotment from the selling organization, or reject it altogether, such a display of independence could risk not being invited to subsequent meetings.\n\n''To refuse could be financial suicide,'' said Michael Freedman, president of the Gemstone Trading Corporation, a leading diamond investment company.\n\nTo accept an allotment, however, can be painful. The selling organization, which raised prices last February by an average of 13 percent, partly as a reflection of the soaring market at that time, has not lowered them as demand as fallen. As a result, every five weeks sightholders have to pay record prices for rough diamonds that they polish and resell - if they are able to sell at all - at a discount of up to 20 percent. ''There's a new game on the street: squeeze the cutters,'' said Mr. Rapaport. De Beers's Concessions\n\nAdmittedly, De Beers has made some concessions to its sightholders. Many have been allowed to accept smaller allotments, with less expensive stones.\n\n''This month, many sightholders asked to have $300,000, rather than $500,000, in their sight,'' said Mr. Hasenfeld, who buys at De Beers's smaller sights for polished stones in Lucerne. In addition, he said, De Beers has permitted some of its clients to miss a sight.\n\nIn fact, while De Beers is not trying to prop up diamond prices by buying stock, its sales figures indicate that it has not been flooding the market either. During the second half of 1980, De Beers sold only $1.16 billion in rough gemstones and industrial diamonds to its customers, compared with $1.33 billion for the similar period in 1979 - and a sizable decrease from $1.57 billion, its sales for the first half of 1980.\n\n''In the short term, supply and demand will not necessarily equate,'' observed a De Beers spokesman. Eventually, however, De Beers and its clients seem confident that the situation will correct itself and that diamond prices will rise.\n\n''The sightholders are hurting,'' admitted Mr. Izhakoff, ''but when business is good, they make that much more.'' He added, ''If I could, I'd become a sightholder today.''\n\nIllustrations: Photo of a diamond cutter Graph of diamond prices",

        "output": "Diamonds may still be a girl's best friend, but they have proven to be unfaithful companions for investors and dealers in recent months.   After soaring last February, the wholesale price of diamonds fell steeply last spring and has continued to drop steadily this winter.  Since September, according to Martin Rapaport, author of a monthly report on wholesale diamond prices, prices have fallen by nearly 11 percent, including a drop of 6 percent in the last month alone.   The tumbling diamond prices have not yet reached the consumer, but they are taking their toll among the people who buy and sell precious stones. On New York's 47th Street, which is usually lined with people haggling over fistfuls of precious stones, dealer enthusiasm has waned as have the number of deals. While many of the long-time residents of the street refuse to discuss the matter - there is a general fear that mention of falling diamond prices will further the decline - others admit that times have rarely been so hard."

Today, there are more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam's Club locations in the US alone.\n\nWalmart's dominance has created an environment where it's difficult for retailers to compete in an overcrowded market. The issue is complicated by recent changes in the retail industry, with more shopping being done online — another factor that is creating more competition for retailers.

        "instruction": "HONOLULU, Dec. 31— The Hawaiian custom of shooting off firecrackers to welcome the New Year is on trial this holiday season. The sale of firecrackers is a $4 million-a-year business in this c ity, and to allow or to prohibit virtually u nrestricted access to firecrackers is a controversy widely debated every year about this time.\n\nThis year the argument peaked in Honolulu's official circles, courts, newspapers, television discussions and on radio talk shows. Mayor Eileen Anderson and the two major papers, The Honolulu Advertiser and The Star-Bulletin, have been leading a campaign, so far unsuccessful, to ban the sale of firecrackers except to groups for ceremonial or religious use on such occasions as the Fourth of July and Chinese New Year, a movable festival that falls on Jan. 26 in 1982.\n\nThe Fire and Police Departments say indiscriminate use of firecrackers is a threat to life and property. The Hawaiian Humane Society cites the distress of animals from the racket in residential neighborhoods.\n\nAgainst the proposed ban are ethnic Chinese who cherish their practice of detonating countless small firecrackers to frighten off evil spirits on Chinese New Year.\n\nMany native Hawaiians of other ethnic groups have grown accustomed all their lives to using such explosives on festive occasions, and they oppose a ban. ''Shooting firecrackers is a pastime that keeps families together,'' read a recent letter to a newspaper.\n\nAccording to a survey of public opinion conducted for The Advertiser and published last week, 30 percent of those questioned favored an ou tright ban on selling firecrackers, but 40 percent wanted some k ind of restriction; about 30 percent wanted no limit. In Politics, a Sensitive Issue\n\nPoliticians are been sensitive to the issue. City Councilman Frank Loo has drawn up a proposal making it unlawful to interfere with Hawaii's ''cultural heritage,'' which he defines as including, among other things, firecrackers, the hula and Japanese dances in veneration of the dead.\n\nThe Mayor's proposal prohibiting general selling of fireworks was temporarily shelved in favor of a compromise offered by Councilman Tom Nekota that requires the purchaser of fireworks to obtain a permit from the Fire Department.\n\nIn three days, fire stations around received thousands of applications for permits, but they could process only a few hundred because a fire safety inspector is required to check each site where the fireworks are to be set off.\n\nThose who sell fireworks challenged the law in court, and a judge ruled the permit requirement unconstitutional as too vague. That decision also invalidated an earlier safety law banning private use of rockets and Roman candles. The Fire Department, invoking emergency powers, issued a new regulation temporarily restoring the prohibition. Waikiki Ban Left Intact\n\nHowever, a section that barred fireworks in areas zoned for highrise buildings, such as Waikiki, was left intact. The authorities later interpreted that section of the ordinance as covering the whole central city and most of its residential outskirts, including sections where high-rise buildings have been authorized but not built.\n\nMeanwhile, anybody can buy all the fireworks he wants. Among those who set them off gleefully in the crowded canyon-like hotel and condominium areas of Waikiki are young visitors from the mainland United States and Canadian communities where firecrackers are prohibited.\n\nIn the past few days firecracker-popping in Waikiki and other heavily populated sections has been subdued, possibly because of warnings by the news media and hotel managers that fireworks are illegal in Waikiki. Where they are legal, they may be set off only between 5 P.M. New Year's Eve and 1 A.M. Jan. 1. Selling, but Not Much Blasting\n\nSince the sales began last week, there have been only intermittent blasts in the streets or from firecrackers dropped from balconies. Both practices are strictly illegal.\n\nThe time restrictions were in the previous law but widely ignored by the public and the police, who considered the provision unenforceable.\n\nThe police made little or no attempt to enforce the previous, looser law. Now they are planning reinforced patrols in Waikiki and other proscribed neighborhoods to look for violators who can be fined as much as $500 and jailed for 30 days.\n\nLeaders of the Chinese community, sensing a threat to their cherished institution if new abuses result in new support for Mayor Anderson's outright ban, have appealed to the public to obey the law.\n\n''We want this to be a lawful, safe a nd san e New Year's celebration,'' William Y.@C. Lee, the preside nt of the United ChineseSociety, said this week. The society includes more than 75 Chinese organizations.",

They are not particularly close -Mr. Byrne endorsed former Attorney General John J. Degnan in the June primary. Byrne Points to His Record\n\nOne reason Mr. Byrne has been missing from the campaign trail is that he returned on Friday from a two-week trip to Europe. Mr. Byrne noted that while Mr. Florio might not choose to be associated with him personally, the candidate could take advantage of the Byrne record.\n\n''He has the advantage of the programs and the reforms that have come about,'' the Governor said. ''And he's taking full advantage of that while putting forth his own personality.''\n\nIn his campaign speeches, however, Mr. Florio has not been mentioning the Byrne administration or its programs. The Governor's popularity has dropped markedly in the last two years and polls taken for Mr. Florio have shown that voters are particularly irked at the naming of a sports arena in East Rutherford for Mr. Byrne.

Hamilton Jr., of New Brunswick, the campaign chairman for Mr. Florio, said Mr. Kean voted to increase tho corporate business tax on three occasion between 1968 and 1975 - the tax rose from 3.25 to 7.5 percent in that period - and to increase the state sales tax from 3 percent to 5 percent in 1970. Kean Proposes Tax Cuts\n\nMr. Kean has promised sharp cuts in business taxes and proposes a 1 percent cut in the sales tax three years into his first term, if he is elected. He has consistently attacked the Byrne administration whose taxing policies, he says, are responsible for an antibusiness climate in New Jersey.\n\nMr. Hamilton described Mr. Kean as a ''political opportunist who has been on so many sides of so many issues over the years that there is no way to tell where he stands or how long he will stay there.''\n\nIn response, Mr. Kean said that two of the corporate tax increases he voted for were parts of proposed income tax packages that would have had the net effect of reducing the overall tax impact on businesses. He said the Democrats had taken his votes ''out of context.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Governor Byrne with James J. Florio and Andrew J. Adams photo of Thomas H. Kean with campaign workers",

        "instruction": "IT seems that lemon verbena's time has finally come. At last, a plant to grow, a fresh herb to use for flavoring and dried leaves to brew -- all in one.\n\nThe seductive floral-citrus scent and taste of this energizing, graceful herb can now be found in imported soap; in ice cream, sorbets, cakes, fruit syrups and spritzers, and as a flavoring with fish. Chefs and home cooks alike are exploring the myriad uses of lemon verbena.\n\n''I'm crazy about lemon verbena,'' said Jerry Traunfeld, the chef at the Herbfarm, a 12.5-acre nursery and herb complex in Fall City, Wash. ''To me it tastes like lemon drops.''\n\nThe restaurant at the Herbfarm, which is about 30 miles east of Seattle, burned down last spring. While it is being rebuilt, Mr. Traunfeld is writing ''The Herbfarm Cookbook,'' to be published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1998. He is focusing on 30 fresh herbs, including lemon verbena, from several acres of kitchen gardens at the nursery.\n\n''It has all the flavor of lemon with the bonus of an intense perfume of its own,'' Mr. Traunfeld said of the herb. ''And although the leaf itself isn't sweet, it's a beautiful dessert herb.''\n\nIn Manhattan, the Ciao Bella Gelato Company added a lemon verbena sorbet to its line in the spring because, said Lori Lechtman, the executive chef, ''so many chefs were asking me for it.''\n\nOne of them, Melissa O'Donnell, the chef at La Cigale on Mott Street, said lemon verbena sorbet is one of the most popular desserts at the year-old bistro.\n\n''No one seems to know what lemon verbena is,'' Ms. O'Donnell said, ''but when customers try it, they almost always like it as much as I do.''\n\nLemon verbena, which has a distinct lemon lilt, does not taste like any of the other lemon-based plants, like lemon balm, lemon mint, lemon thyme or lemon grass. It has a lighter, less aggressive flavor that can be best described as lemon perfume.\n\n''People are definitely drawn to it,'' said Mina Binder, an owner of Binder Farms of Sayville, N.Y., which sells potted herbs at the Union Square Greenmarket. One customer, Pauline Wyman, stopped by last Saturday just to smell. ''I think it must be addictive,'' she said, inhaling deeply.\n\nThe lemon verbena plant, Aloysia triphylla, which has long stems and slender, feather-shaped leaves, is just catching on in this country. But in Europe, particularly in France (where it is called verveine or verveine citronelle), it has been used for years as a base for tea, a flavoring in cooking and liquors and a fragrance in perfumes and soaps. In Portugal, Achilles Brito, a soap-making company, uses lemon verbena from Grasse, in southeast France, to make hand-milled aged soaps.\n\nIn Morocco, where lemon verbena is called louisa, big bunches are sold in outdoor markets. The leaves are steeped in hot water to make a tea said to be good for menstrual cramps and stomachaches. And in South America, where the plant originated, lemon verbena grows in abundance, particularly in Chile and Peru, perfuming the air.\n\nBut American shoppers may find that their best source is a plant of their own. A fresh bunch of the herb, often available in markets in California and the Northwest, is not so easy to find on the East Coast, although potted plants can sometimes be found at farmers' markets in the summer.\n\nMs. Lechtman, the chef at Ciao Bella, says she has yet to find a large fresh supply of the herb. So for the sorbet, she uses dried lemon verbena leaves imported from France through the Harney & Sons Tea Company in Salisbury, Conn.\n\nFor cooks who need the herb on a smaller scale, lemon verbena plants are currently on sale at many Greenmarkets for $3 to $6 each. Grown in a sunny spot indoors or outside and kept well watered, the plants grow like wildfire -- often to three feet high -- and can become very bushy. They have a delicate flower, too, a spray of edible white blossoms.\n\nTo keep the plants in line and to make them flourish, sprigs of leaves should be cut from the top frequently. If grown outside, a potted lemon verbena plant can be wintered over inside.\n\nSanford D'Amato, the owner of Sanford Restaurant in Milwaukee, harvests lemon verbena from his kitchen garden. Mr. D'Amato, who won a James Beard Award last year as the best chef in the Midwest, heats the leaves in half-and-half to extract the flavor and strains the mixture, mixing it with cream and egg yolks for a rich ice cream.\n\nMr. Traunfeld, of Herbfarm, grinds two parts lemon verbena leaves with one part sugar in a food processor to extract the flavor oils. He uses the resulting mixture to make an intensely lemony spongecake and lemon curd. He also freezes it for use yearlong.\n\nAnother way to extract all the flavor essence from the herb is to steep the leaves in a wine-and-sugar syrup, which can be used to sweeten iced tea and lemonade, for a fruit compote or as a base for a spritzer.\n\nThose meeting lemon verbena for the first time might want to start with a tisane, or herb infusion, like the one offered on the menu at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif. A large patch of lemon verbena grows outside the restaurant so profusely that ''we have to beat it back with sticks,'' said Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse.",

At the higher price, the issue yields 14.97 percent to maturity compared with a 15.32 percent yield at the low price.\n\nShort-term interest rates, meanwhile, were mixed yesterday as Treasury bill rates fell while other money market rates rose. While rates moved in different directions for money market instruments, the pattern for all kinds of securities is for longer maturities to carry higher interest rates - a good sign that issuers, dealers and investors expect rates to be higher in six months. An Uncertain Outlook\n\nAlbert Wojnilower, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said yesterday that the uncertain outlook for the economy and interest rates was likely to persist. In a speech to the Georgetown Forum, Mr. Wojnilower concluded that ''we should expect to muddle along with little economic growth and persistent financial unease as we have already done for three years.''\n\nMr. Wojnilower said that the recent Federal budget reductions were simply ''timing cosmetics''. He contended that what he termed ''small reductions'' would make ''little impression on the market'' and would only intensify the strains on the corporate and municipal sectors.\n\n''Large cuts will get interst rates down if - and only if - they are so large as to engender a deep-seated expectation of a pronounced recession,'' he said. ''Bond prices would rally, but the business community and stock market would be left with little to cheer about.''\n\nBy this time next year, Mr. Wojnilower said he expected short- and long-term rates to be somewhat higher than they are now. He said he also expected the Federal Reserve to avoid causing a recession by too strict a rein on money supply growth. A recession would increase the risks of a financial calamity, he said, because it would lead to a falloff in the cash flow that business needed to sustain record high short-term borrowings. Treasury Bill Market\n\nIn the Treasury bill market the pattern for rates to rise as maturities lengthen is so great that Treasury bills due Oct. 8 and Oct. 15 are bid at about 12 3/4 percent compared with 14.08 percent for three-month bills and 14.56 percent for six-month bills. In yesterday's trading the rate on three-month bills fell much more than the six-month rate because of the preference for short maturities, dealers said.\n\nParticipants in the money markets attribute part of the strong demand for issues due in 30 days or less to money market mutual funds that are prepared to accommodate an outflow of funds by investors who are expected to buy the new tax-exempt savings certificates that go on sale Thursday.\n\nElsewhere in the money market, specialists said that overnight financing rates - which were as low as 13 1/4 percent yesterday - might increase after tomiorrow when $8.75 bil lion is drained from themarket as dealers and investors pay for recen tly auctioned two-year and four-year Treasury notes.\n\nThe rate on overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market increased yesterday with much trading around 14 7/8 percent, compared with an average 14.32 percent rate on Friday. Many analysts said the Federal funds rate might be distorted in coming days by endof-the-quarter window dressing by some banks and by the introduction on Thursday of same-day settlement for foreign transactions. Analysts ar e not certain about whether the same-day settlement would cause t he interest rates for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market to rise or fall, but they agreed that the amounts of mo ney involved were large enough to cause surprising, though tempor ary, distortions in the funds rate.\n\nIn the tax-exempt market, interest rates also gyrated widely, though most of the early losses were recovered late in the day.",

        "instruction": "CROYDON, England, Oct. 21— Day and night, the shabby little storefront on Brigstock Road in this anonymous south London suburb is jammed with excited, laughing, energetic people. Its walls are plastered with crude signs, all of them orange, the color of the Liberal Party. From time to time, a bearded, slightly diffident man bearing the politically resounding name of William Pitt stops by.\n\nThe people in the office on Brigstock Road believe they are making a revolution. They are convinced that tomorrow, Mr. Pitt, a 44-yearold municipal housing officer, will be elected to the House of Commons from the Croydon North West constituency as the candidate of the Liberal-Social Democratic alliance and thereby set the alliance on the road toward ultimate control of the British government.\n\n''There is a strong tide in our favor,'' said David Steel, the Liberal leader, at a news conference this morning. ''I am quite confident that we shall win.''\n\nNaturally enough the candidates of the major parties, Labor and the Conservatives, see the situation differently, but the pollsters and the bookmakers support Mr. Steel. In a last-minute survey by National Opinion Poll to be published in tomorrow's Daily Mail, the alliance is given 35 percent of the vote, the Conservatives 32 percent and Labor 31 percent. Coral's, a leading bookmaker, has installed the alliance as odds-on favorite. Strategists Are Apprehensive\n\nWith the figures that close, and with their instincts warning them of a tight finish, the strategists of all three parties are a bit apprehensive. All three have a great deal at stake in this byelection, held to fill the seat made vacant by the death of Robert Taylor, the constituency's Tory Member of Parliament for 11 years.\n\nFor the alliance, which was officially formed only a month ago, Croydon North West offers a chance to prove that the strong showing of the Social Democratic candidate at the Warrington by-election this summer, Roy Jenkins, was no accident. For the Tories, it offers a chance to prove that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policies retain some support in the country. And for Labor, it offers a chance to prove that the party has put its internal squabbles aside and is able to present itself again as the prime alternative to the Tories.\n\nAn alliance victory would constitute a stunning achievement. Running under the Liberal banner in the 1979 general election, Mr. Pitt polled only 10.5 percent of the vote; he was considered such a weak candidate that the Social Democrats tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stand aside in favor of Shirley Williams, the former Labor Cabinet minister. And there is nothing in the makeup of the constituency, a sprawl of modest commuters' row houses in the $50,000 class, to suggest a rich harvest of votes for the Liberals. Negative Kind of Appeal\n\nMr. Pitt's - and, to a degree, the alliance's - appeal to the people of Croydon North West would appear to be negative. The local weekly newspaper, The Croydon Advertiser, backed him in these terms in an editorial last week:\n\n''The sterile monetarism of the present Conservative Government offers no solutions, nor does the revolutionary Socialism that would dominate the Labor Party if it came to power. Both need the shock of an alliance victory. To support any new political movement is a leap in the dark, and it may be that the alliance, were it to succeed to government, would be no more successful. But it does offer some better hope. Consensus is better than the confrontation the others offer.''\n\nMichael Foot, the Labor leader, all but conceded the point at a news conference tonight. If Labor lost, he said, it would do so not because of any shortcomings in its candidate, Stanley Boden, a 46-year-old history teacher, but because ''of the whole background to the situation'' - presumably meaning the rise of the Social Democrats and the squabbling, far-left reputation that the Labor Party has earned.\n\nMr. Bodin hammers away at unemployment, the issue that would under normal circumstances guarantee him victory. He tells voters on the doorsteps that the national unemployment total of three million is a disgrace, and brings the point down to the local level by reminding them that in Croydon, normally a prosperous place, half of the 3,000 students who left school last summer have failed to find jobs. Called Wasted Vote by Labor\n\nHe and his backers also attempt to suggest that a vote for Mr. Pitt is a wasted vote. At a rally tonight, Neil Kinnock, a leading Labor M.P., said that ''the Conservative Government will regard the Liberal votes in Croydon as a spasm of protest, not as a demand for changes in the policies of cuts, closures, high interest rates and increased unemployment; only Labor votes will leave a real mark on the Tory Government because they will be votes for a real alternative.''\n\nFor the Conservative candidate, John Butterfill, a prosperous, 40-year-old real-estate man, the greatest ally is Kenneth Livingstone, a Marxist, the Labor chairman of the Greater London Council, whose policies have resulted in huge increases in property taxes, making him and his party unpopular in Croydon.\n\nMr. Butterfill has tried to play down Mrs. Thatcher's economic policies, bringing in Conservative critics of those policies, including former Prime Minister Edward Heath, to campaign alongside him. Knocking on doors in trim, cozy Upper Norwood this afternoon, he was pleased with the number of people who said they were sticking with the Tories.\n\n''Where are the defectors?'' he asked at one point. ''The polls tell me I'm losing a third of the vote we got last time, but I can't see it out in the streets.''",

        "instruction": "ROME, Dec. 1— Italy's Christian Democrats, who lost the Prime Ministership last summer for the first time in 36 years, have just concluded a General Assembly at which speaker after speaker called for the rejuvenation of the party, a ''new morality'' and an end to scandals and corruption.\n\nOnly new leaders and new ideas can save the party now, most speakers said. By the end of the General Assembly Sunday night, the old-guard leaders, who have dominated the party and the country for decades, joined the chorus, but apparently without any thought of stepping down.\n\nMost of the speeches reflected the disenchantment of party members. There was widespread concern that the party, having lost the Prime Ministership, is caught in an irreversible decline and will eventually lose its dominant position altogether. Article Is Not Encouraging\n\nAccording to a recent article in the news magazine L'Europeo, only one in nine Italians wants a Christian Democrat to lead the Government again. The magazine's poll was conducted five months after Giovanni Spadolini, head of the small Republican Party, became Prime Minister. Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, also wants to be Prime Minister, and his party has been gaining ground, as several speakers at the Christian Democratic assembly noted.\n\nOne delegate, Giuseppe Costamagna, a Member of Parliament from Turin, accused the party leadership of under-the-table dealings in exercising power, and he said that the leaders were clinging to their offices long beyond their time. He asked Amintore Fanfani, who was briefly Prime Minister in the early 1960's and who is the party's eldest leader: ''Do you intend to step down or not? Will you make rotation possible or not?''\n\nMr. Costamagna did not cite Mr. Fanfani by name, but he identified him by his role in the party and there was no mistaking whom he meant.\n\nAnother delegate, Achille Ardigo, threatened to take the initiative in founding ''another Catholic party'' if the Christian Democrats failed to adopt what he said were necessary changes. A similar threat came from Roberto Formigone, another delegate. 'Method of Procrastination'\n\nUmberto Agnelli, a former party deputy and a brother of Giovanni Agnelli, president of the Fiat Motor Company, told the assembly that the Christian Democrats had become a ''party of mediation'' that had lost its ability to make decisions and systematically resorted to ''the method of procrastination.''\n\nBenigno Zaccagnini, a former party secretary, charged that the factions inside the party had degenerated to the point where their only purpose was ''to conquer and retain power.''\n\n''It is not the Christian Democratic idea that is unattainable or outdated,'' he said, ''but it is our behavior that has not shown sufficient respect to this idea.''\n\nContrary to the prevailing trend within the party, which has been toward greater independence from the Roman Catholic Church, Mr. Zaccagnini called on the party to stress its ''Christian inspiration'' and its belief in ''religious values.''\n\nIn a vote at the end of the assembly, the party leaders went along with a proposal from the floor to have future party secretaries elected by a Christian Democratic convention instead of by agreement between the leaders of various factions.\n\nThe General Assembly was attended by delegates from organizations and groups that support the Christian Democratic Party without formally being a part of it. The party invited them in the hope of restoring its image as a broadly based Roman Catholic party.",

Last year, bondholders had filed more than $800 million in claims against Energy Future based on contract provisions that protected bondholders against early payoff of their debt.\n\nThe company declined to comment.\n\n“We are very pleased with the decision and believe it is correct,” said Philip Anker, lawyer for the bondholders.\n\n“It’s going to shift a lot of value from junior creditors back up to senior secured creditors,” said John Greene, a portfolio manager at Halcyon Capital Management LP, a New York asset manager that holds Energy Future bond debt. “We feel vindicated by the decision, which enforced our contractual rights.”\n\nHit with falling energy prices, Energy Future, the former TXU Corp., filed for chapter 11 protection in April 2014, grappling with some $42 billion in debt.\n\nThe dispute with bondholders over whether they are entitled to collect a so-called make-whole premium on billions of dollars of debt paid off early began before the bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe appeals court said a bankruptcy judge should have enforced the contract provision that protected bondholders against early payoff of their debt. Such provisions are common in the sophisticated debt deals many companies rely on for financing, but Energy Future contended its bankruptcy changed the legal situation.\n\nThursday’s ruling is a setback for the company, which ran up a series of wins on the dispute in the lower courts.\n\nConfirmation hearings are slated to start Dec. 1 for Energy Future’s chapter 11 exit plan, which is premised on the idea the company properly escaped paying a make-whole premium when it refinanced some of its senior loans while in bankruptcy.\n\nNextEra Energy Inc. may also have to grapple with the consequences of Thursday’s appeals-court ruling. The Florida power company is poised to help Energy Future out of bankruptcy by buying its Oncor electricity transmission business in a transaction that values Oncor at more than $18 billion.\n\nIt isn’t clear what the ruling that boosts Energy Future’s debt by hundreds of millions of dollars will do to NextEra’s takeover proposal.\n\nNextEra spokesman Rob Gould said Thursday the company is aware of the decision and reviewing it.\n\nThursday’s ruling from the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sets the stage for a challenge to the Energy Future exit plan from bondholders.\n\nInvestors in some $4 billion in first-lien debt are now entitled to demand more than they are slated to receive under the plan, and that would mean less for other creditors of Energy Future. At the time of the refinancing, in June 2014, the make-whole premium was worth $431 million.\n\nThe amount has changed over time, as bondholders added claims for interest. First-lien bondholders may seek more than $550 million, thanks to the ruling.\n\nThe decision also affects $2.2 billion worth of Energy Future’s second-lien bonds. Owners of the second-lien bonds may seek more than $200 million in premium pay. Some bond investors accepted settlement offers early in the case that reduced the make-whole premium liability.\n\nWrite to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com and Matthew Jarzemsky at matthew.jarzemsky@wsj.com",

        "instruction": "Banner Gala, a speedy filly being pointed toward the Belmont Stakes, was scratched from the Peter Pan Stakes yesterday for having inadvertently been medicated with a pain-killer, according to a steward for the State Racing and Wagering Board.\n\nThe mile-and-an-eighth Peter Pan was used as a Belmont tuneup for Tap Shoes, who showed some signs that he will fulfill the promise he never achieved after suffering an injury in his 2-year-old season. He won, as expected, but only by a neck from Willow Hour.\n\nThis morning, Pleasant Colony, winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, worked out for the first time since the Preakness victory. He needs only to win the Belmont on June 6 to become the 13th horse to sweep the Triple Crown series since Sir Barton did it in 1919.\n\nAngel Penna, the Argentine trainer who conditions Banner Gala, said he was ''very upset'' by the developments, but Belmont officials assured him that there would be several other races in the next week to test his horse.\n\nBanner Gala, the only filly that remains a candidate for the Belmont on June 6, is owned by Ogden Phipps, whose son, Ogden Mills Phipps, is chairman of the New York Racing Association. Phipps had hoped that a good performance in the Peter Pan would prepare his filly for the Belmont and a share of the kind of glory attained by Genuine Risk last year when she won the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe first Belmont, in 1867, was taken by a filly, Ruthless, but it was 38 years before a filly won again, Tanya in 1905. It hasn't happened since. Duel in the Stretch\n\nTap Shoes, the highweight yesterday under 126 pounds, was sorely tested in a rousing stretch duel with Willow Hour (117). The pair were 11 lengths ahead of third-place West on Broad (120) and were timed in 1:48 2/5.\n\n''I think we'll go in the Belmont,'' said Horatio Luro, the 80-year-old trainer of Tap Shoes, who returned $3.40 to his $2 backers in the crowd of 41,136. ''We have no other choice.''\n\nHow Banner Gala might have affected the outcome - and Luro's decison - remains conjecture. Banner Gala was the victim of mistaken identity. According to Salvatore J. Ferrara, the steward for the State Racing and Wagering Board, Penna and an assistant trainer went from stall to stall in Barn 26 shortly after dawn, feeding their horses. Mistake by Aide\n\nUpon reaching the tack room, they realized that Divorce Decree, the horse in the stall next to Banner Gala, had not been given a dosage of equiproxin, an anti-inflammatory drug. An assistant stable foreman was sent back to medicate Divorce Decree.\n\nIn New York, no horse is permitted to run with any trace of drugs in its system. Drugs may be use to treat horses with problems, but the horse then may not compete until the drug dissipates, usually about 48 hours.\n\n''He missed,'' said Ferrara. Instead, the analgesic was administered to the filly, and the prerace testing lab notified the stewards that her test had turned up positive.\n\nIt was then 12:22 P.M., about five hours before post time for the Peter Pan. The stewards phoned Penna, and he hurried to their office. ''Nothing like this has ever happened to me before,'' he said. Penna has trained some of the most successful fillies in the sport, including two winners of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, San San and Allez France, and Waya, a winner of several stakes. Had Won 3 of 4\n\nPenna had said that Banner Gala ''must run real well'' in the Peter Pan, and not simply win it to get into the Belmont. She won the Rare Perfume Stakes last month and then took an allowance race by 13 lengths that strengthened her claim as a Belmont Stakes contender. She has three victories and a second in four career starts.\n\nAngel Cordero, who was to ride the filly, said: ''I really feel bad for the trainer but it would have been a lot worse if the drug wasn't detected until later. It would have been very embarrassing.''\n\nDavid Stevenson, the director of racing for the N.Y.R.A., echoed Cordero's view. ''Thank God for prerace testing,'' he said. ''Suppose we ran the race, and then it happened.''\n\nA first offense for drugs uncovered in prerace testing is generally overlooked by the stewards but a second offense within a year calls for a $250 fine and a third can lead to suspension of a trainer's license. In New York racing, a trainer is held responsible for any positive drug finding, regardless of how the drug got into a horse's system. Pleasant Colony in Brisk Workout\n\nWhile the events leading to the filly's being scratched were unfolding, Pleasant Colony had a brisk workout. He sped five furlongs in 0:59 4/5.\n\nJohnny Campo, his trainer, nodded his approval of the fast clocking and said: ''He was getting just a little bored. Maybe this will wake him up a bit.'' It was Pleasant Colony's first serious workout since he won the Preakness.\n\nAnother large holiday crowd is expected today, when Cure the Blues will return to action in the Metropolitan Mile. LeRoy Jolley, his trainer, says the colt is completely recovered from a foot infection that was detected after his disappointing finish in the Derby.\n\nGenuine Risk will make her first career start over grass when she takes on five other fillies in an allowance race. She is expected to be a 1-5 favorite in the mile-and-a-sixteenth contest.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Pleasant Colony",

Wendy's serves breakfast at certain locations with plenty of foot traffic, but the CEO has said it would require too much marketing to expand the service to all locations.\n\nIn general, this issue of to-go convenience is what separates the winners from the losers when it comes to the fast-food breakfast game.\n\nThe biggest sellers in fast-food are the most convenient, with hand-held icons like McDonald's McMuffin, Dunkin's donuts, and the A.M. Crunchwrap, called by Taco Bell's chief marketing officer Chris Brandt, \"the most portable breakfast sandwich in the business\" when it was introduced. Even at Boston Market, the most popular pick has been the breakfast burrito — an unexpected success for a chain best known for its rotisserie chicken.\n\nThe items that are quickest to leave the menu are those that aren't as portable for on-the-go eating. While the Waffle Taco made headlines when Taco Bell debuted its breakfast menu, critics questioned its portability and the chain ditched the dish after a year. Similarly, Boston Market tested a breakfast pot pie, but ditched the concept in favor of sandwiches and burritos.\n\nIn 2016, consumers care more about a convenient breakfast than ever, with 40% of millennials believing that cereal is an inconvenient breakfast choice because they have to clean up.\n\nHowever, when customers are convinced that a fast-food chain can save them time, it becomes an indispensable part of their morning routine. Customers are more likely to eat the same thing every day for breakfast than any other meal, meaning that regulars can drive a huge amount of business for chains.\n\nNot every fast-food chain needs to enter the breakfast space. However, those that do need to make sure that they never are wasting even a second of customers' time.\n\nNOW WATCH: Here's how Walgreens' Nice! brand cookies compare to their Girl Scout counterparts\n\nSEE ALSO: Millennials aren't eating cereal because it's too much work",

        "instruction": "SecondMarket, Sharespost, NYPPEX all let wealthy investors treat private companies, like Facebook, as publicly traded ones. Are they flouting securities laws, or reinventing them for the 21st century?\n\nSorry, small investors. If you want to buy shares in Facebook, Groupon or Twitter, you’re going to have to wait until their IPOs.\n\nThat much is certain now that the Securities and Exchange Commission has started looking into the trading of shares in privately held companies. What’s less clear right now is how SEC’s involvement will affect the market for buying and selling of shares in fast-growing startups. While new regulations could shut down the market before it has a chance to take off, it looks more likely that the SEC’s interest could prompt the market to evolve in a way that minimizes risks for investors.\n\n“I think it’s a good thing the SEC is looking into this area,” said Robert Heim, an attorney at Meyers & Heim who previously worked at the SEC. “I suspect we may see more firms that provide these markets registering as broker dealers and falling under a more regulated structure.”\n\nUntil last year, such so-called secondary transactions took place in a sleepy little niche in the equity markets. But a new crop of companies like SecondMarket and Sharespost started running eBay-like auctions for equity in private startups, drawing a torrent of interest from institutional investors and retail investors alike for an early entry into the next big tech star.\n\nAs demand rose, so did the valuations that the auctions accorded to startups: Facebook’s putative value has doubled from $30 billion in September to $60 billion last month. (Amazon, by comparison, is worth $80 billion.) Reports of surging valuations put the new secondary markets sites on the radar of many investors, but they may also be drawing regulatory scrutiny.\n\n“It boils down to the reality that you have trading in stocks of companies that makes them look like public companies,” said Gary Aguirre, a former SEC attorney now at the Aguirre Law Firm. “Accredited and institutional investors can fare on their own. But if it slips down the food chain to retail investors who are clueless about what they are getting into, then it can get very sticky.”\n\nSecurities laws define accredited investors as banks, pension funds or charities with assets exceeding $5 million, as well as individuals with a net worth above $1 million or income exceeding $200,000 a year. Heim said regulators may want to see how closely the secondary-market firms are vetting investors as accredited before they let them participate in stock transactions.\n\nWho in the secondary market survives an SEC investigation\n\nAny fallout from the SEC’s scrutiny of the private secondary markets is likely to hurt newer entrants who aren’t licensed as broker dealers. Licensed firms with a longer history – such as SecondMarket, founded in 2004, and NYPPEX, which has been in the private secondary markets since 1998 – are likely to weather a shakeout.\n\nSecondMarket has emerged as the largest trader of private stock in big-name web startups. The company began by trading illiquid securities such as restricted stock in public companies and auction-rate securities during the market turmoil of 2008. After a former Facebook employee approached the company about selling some of his shares in the company, SecondMarket began exploring such transactions in April 2009.\n\nSecondMarket charges a transaction fee between 3% and 5% of the proceeds raised from all private equity transactions, which are averaging about $2 million in size. Such fees make up less than half of SecondMarket’s revenue, but is its fastest growing area of its operations. In 2010, the company saw $100 million from transactions in private companies, a figure that rose to $400 million last year.\n\n“The number of buyers is also growing,” says Jeremy Smith, SecondMarket’s chief strategy officer. “They pretty much run the gamut of the investment community. It’s now venture capital funds, hedge funds, asset managers and high net-worth individuals.”\n\nAnother hazard of the secondary private market is that poor disclosure, since investors aren’t guaranteed the trove of financial information in a prospectus for a public offering. Smith said SecondMarket sets up online “data rooms” that offer potential buyers access to documents such as articles of incorporation, financial statements or management commentary on the company that buyers can use in valuing a company’s shares.\n\nTo encourage companies to share such information, SecondMarket allows the companies to decide who can buy or sell shares. “It gives them a level of control, so that they don’t have a competitor buying the stock,” said Smith. “By making them more comfortable this way, you make them more comfortable revealing information.”\n\nSecondMarket sees the secondary-transaction market growing beyond a niche as private companies in other industries like biotech or consulting start participating. The company is exploring a move next year into primary markets as well, helping companies to sell shares directly to institutional investors as an alternative to venture capital.\n\nThe challenge for firms like SecondMarket as they explore new ways to help facilitate equity transactions for private companies is to evolve while remaining in compliance with securities laws. For its part, the SEC will need to update those laws in a way that adapts to those evolutions while still protecting investors.\n\n“I believe the SEC recognizes these firms provide a valuable service that is in compliance with the SEC guidance,” said Heim. “But we’re dealing with securities laws passed in the 1930s and Internet technology made in the 21st Century. The SEC will have a challenge in creating regulations that are up to date and protect investors in these securities.”",

They still look like typical boxy vehicles, with room enough for giant tires and roof vents.\n\nBut they are a big step forward when it comes to offering riders technology.\n\nTheir $755,000-a-pop price tag includes $3,000 for USB ports, $2,000 for Wi-Fi and $15,000 for digital screens for travel alerts.\n\nThe buses will replace more than 40 percent of the MTA’s current fleet of 5,700.\n\nThe MTA will put 23 of the federally funded new buses on the streets next month and 52 more by the end of the year.\n\nTwo years from now, there will be 75 of the new buses in Queens, 70 in Brooklyn, 209 in The Bronx and 18 in Manhattan, MTA officials said.\n\nIn total, 2,042 of the new buses will hit the streets in the next five years.

I’m in New York?’ ”\n\nHe referenced Vice President Joe Biden’s now-famous comment that La Guardia is like a third-world country, and said Penn Station is a similar embarrassment.\n\n“Penn Station, to me, is the equivalent, to me, of La Guardia Airport,” Cuomo said.\n\nCuomo announced a $3 billion plan last month to rebuild Penn Station and last year unveiled a massive rehab plan for La Guardia.",

But Hoenig’s remarks Monday before the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations did contain one statement that’s a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nHoenig’s prepared remarks Monday refer off-handedly, in a discussion of the merits of community banks, to the “abnormally slow recovery that we’ve experienced over the past 2½ years.”\n\nThere’s nothing unusual about that statement.

The adjoining 67 Wall was developed in 1921 for Munson Shipping Company on a site that once housed Alexander Hamilton’s offices.\n\nThe buildings are connected with 10,000 square feet of amenity spaces, while retailers in 20,000 square feet include Tumi and La Maison du Chocolate.\n\nThe sellers are DTH Capital and Metro Loft Management which converted the properties after 9/11. DTH is working on the long-awaited 70 Pine St., and Metro Loft on 20 Broad St.\n\nSources said the investment marketing team was Douglas Harmon and Adam Spies of Eastdil Secured which previously sold Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village for $5.45 billion. The parties couldn’t be reached or declined to comment.\n\nWe also heard that Harmon and Spies are putting on The Ritz Plaza to market at prices that could reach around $450 million.\n\nThe 43-story luxury apartment tower at 235 W. 48 St. by Eighth Ave. is being marketed on behalf of Ofer Yardeni of Stonehenge.\n\nMany of the 479 free market apartments have terraces. According to the Stonehenge website, they range from $3,050 for a studio to two bedrooms starting at $5,995 per month. An indoor pool, a tenant lounge, fitness center and rooftop deck are among the amenities.\n\nThe building also includes the Italian restaurant, La Masseria, 20,000 square feet of office space leased to the US General Services Administration and an indoor garage with 160 parking spaces run by Icon.\n\n“It is center ice,” said Richard Dansereau, managing director of Stonehenge of its location between Times Square and Hell’s Kitchen. “There is nothing like it in the market now, but there is significant interest from around the globe for this kind of quality. So we feel the timing is great.”\n\nA small park at its base commemorates the firefighters who perished on Sept. 11th, and whose firehouse is across the street.\n\nAt last week’s groundbreaking, Ian Schrager, lead developer on 160 Leroy St., was enthusiastic about the project being developed with Steve Witkoff and New Valley — whose CEO, Howard Lorber, was in attendance.\n\nAs The Post previously reported, Schrager is purchasing a $15 million unit just below the penthouse. “I think the Leroy apartments are so special I didn’t want to miss the opportunity,” he explained. He and his family now live at 40 Bond St., another of his projects by the same architects, Herzog & de Meuron, where he is actually the board’s president.\n\n“There is no better seal of approval than a developer buying a unit,” Schrager added. “And if I’m living there I will ensure the building will be run well.”\n\nHis partner, Michael Overington, is also buying one of the 49 units, of which so far, two-thirds are spoken for.

The manor creaks mysteriously and the plot creaks transparently in this amusingly suspenseful remake directed by Radley Metzger.\n\nMr. Metzger has forsaken, for the moment at least, the soft-porn cinema, and plays ''The Cat and the Canary'' straight. Well, pretty straight, with only a few relatively feeble insinuations of homosexuality and a suggestion of torture. He has written the screenplay in a way that tries, with varying success, to yoke the comic with the macabre.\n\nThe story was originally written for the stage by John Willard in 1922 and was a movie hit in 1927, when it starred Laura La Plante. It has been, one suspects, somewhat updated, but not disturbingly so, in this version, made about four years ago. The folks in the manor are relatives of a rich old man, dead for 20 years, and they have assembled to hear which of them is heir to his fortune. The deceased, played with high mellifluous good humor by Wilfrid Hyde-White, appears on film to read the will and to twit them on their mediocrity.\n\nThe will is peculiar and leads to murder, mayhem and mystery, all, of course, on a stormy night. Since those in the manor are a very mixed bag, the movie is a vehicle for character acting that might in the old days have kept Central Casting on its toes for a week. But the actors here are good ones, no matter how hammily they mug and leer in keeping with the theme. Here is Wendy Hiller, a dour solicitor, and Carol Lynley, as the lusciously designed heroine. Michael Callan is every bit the fearless hero and Daniel Massey makes a veritable upper-class parasite. Peter McEnery, Honor Blackman, Edward Fox and Olivia Hussey also put themselves under the shadow of suspicion.\n\nWhodunit? If you don't know the story, we'll only go so far as to say that Mr. Metzger dunit, the film, that is. He has a sure awareness of color, the black cat and the white halls, and the film is attractive enough to look at. The suspense is not evenly maintained, but it doesn't matter; this ''Cat and the Canary'' is a breezy, pleasant enough diversion for an hour and a half. Richard L.

He was 9, and I was 7, and we were there about a year.\n\nWhat was it like? The care givers, black-clad nuns, carried short lengths of rubber hose, which they used freely, and had police whistles to quell disturbances. Bed-wetting was endemic. For that, the punishment was to stand outside the refectory holding the stained and smelly bedding while the other students marched into breakfast.\n\nFor more serious infractions -- like attempts at running away, which were frequent -- boys had their heads shaved and were compelled to wear long dresses of overall cloth for weeks.\n\nThe food was bad and included white bread spotted with mold and frequent pallid stews in which a few strings of reddish meat were suspended. A lot of us had diarrhea a lot of the time, and one could be punished with a hosing for bolting to the toilet at times not permitted.\n\nThere was frequent violence, bruising battles among the older boys, fights between certain of these boys and certain nuns with a taste for confrontation, and a steady stream of boys who had reached their teen-age years and were sent off to reform school.\n\nToner boys received no regular medical attention or nursing care, so that small hurts often developed into serious conditions requiring hospitalization. The hospital was heaven compared with daily life at Toner.\n\nAfter a year mother's circumstances sufficiently improved, and she took us back home, but not before one of us had become deeply sullen and angry, the other fantasy-ridden and inward-turning.\n\nSo what is my point? In 1960 I published a novel based on these orphanage experiences called \"Sisters and Brothers,\" and in 1961 met a Welsh woman who had read the British edition. She was on a board of visitors to several orphanages in Wales, some public, others under religious auspices, and remarked on the uncanny resemblances between what I had written and the conditions she encountered on her visits. Nothing had really changed.\n\nIn the early 1970's I heard from a man who had been brought up at St. Michael's Orphanage in Hopewell, N.J. He had found my book in the library and was convinced that I must have based it on the years he spent at St. Michael's.\n\nIn the 1980's a family therapist who had read my book and who had spent several years visiting St. Michael's as a social worker remarked that the only real difference between the two places was that St. Michael's also had a population of girls.\n\nDo those who opt for orphanages as a solution to the crisis in welfare care about what happens to needy children, or do they seriously believe that such institutions have changed or can change very much over the years?

Some analysts say the Dart & Kraft offer was ill considered.\n\n''It's a ludicrous price,'' says Ronald L. Strauss, a senior analyst with William Blair & Company. He contends that Dart & Kraft would have been better off buying back its own shares. ''Where was John Richman a year ago when Hobart was selling for half the price?'' he argued.\n\nJohn M. Richman, 52 years old, is chairman and chief executive of Dart & Kraft. A year ago he held the same posts at the Illinoisbased Kraft Corporation, then a dominant but slow-growing food processor eager to diversify. The merger with the faster-growing Dart, he has said, accomplished a 10-year acquisition plan for Kraft with one stroke. Making the Marriage Work\n\nNow Mr. Richman is confronting the problems of making the marriage work - and says that the 275 people who are to form the leadership and staff of the new company are getting along well.\n\nMost analysts have a wait-and-see attitude about the transition, which is scheduled to be completed next summer. Their initial reaction to the combination was positive. Some, like Mr. Strauss, soured on the company as an investment after the Hobart bid. Others are cautious. They say they are familiar with either the Dart or the Kraft side, but not with both.\n\nThe four men who make up the Dart & Kraft executive brain trust are Mr. Richman; Warren L. Batts, 48, president; Justin Dart, 73, executive committee chairman, and William E. Reidy, 50, senior vice president for corporate strategy and development.\n\nOf the new company's thirteen senior corporate positions - chief executive, president, three senior vice presidents and eight corporate vice presidents -twelve have been filled so far, with five Kraft executives, five Dart executives and two from outside. Mr. Richman said, however, that there was no conscious effort to keep the balance equal.\n\nOf the four most important executives, only Mr. Dart is close to the diverse businesses of Los Angeles-based Dart, which include batteries, cookware, Tupperware, chemicals and plastics.\n\nThomas P. Mullaney, Dart's president for three years, quit last August, two months after the merger was announced. Mr. Mullaney, 47, who had been a candidate to succeed Mr. Dart as chief executive, is credited by analysts with bringing more discipline and direction to Dart.\n\nThis week, Dart will lose another key executive. Phillip Matthews, vice president and chief financial officer, will depart for the Whittaker Corporation, a diversified chemicals and manufacturing company. No successor has been named to his post, which will be a senior vice presidency for finance. Few Problems Cited\n\nMr. Richman acknowledged that Dart managers and corporate officers might be cautious of their new generals in Illinois. ''You're putting two staffs together and you'll get some of that,'' he said. ''But there has been precious little'' in the way of problems.\n\nOrganization specialists say the management of change is an art of grasping opportunities that new arrangments are designed to exploit, while quelling uncertainties that typically shake management.\n\nBig changes in operating procedures were confined to people in the top layers of the old hierarchies, Mr. Richman said. The jobs of brand managers for Kraft products, like Miracle Whip salad dressing or Philadelphia cream cheese, ''haven't changed a bit,'' he said. Mr. Richman said he and Mr. Batts had charted the reorganization without outside help.\n\n''Each department head at the corporate level participated in discussions of how we could best run the company,'' Mr. Batts said. ''We multiplied the efforts of a lot of people by doing it ourselves. We don't have any 'Not Invented Here' factors to overcome.''\n\nMr. Richman, then senior vice president for administration, was responsible for a major Kraft reorganization three years ago. Mr. Batts helped direct a successful new strategy at the Mead Corporation in the 1970's. A year ago, he resigned without explanation from Mead, where he was president and chief executive. Six Separate Units\n\nMr. Richman has ruled out blending Kraft products with Dart divisions. Instead, Kraft is being managed as one of six separate business units under the Dart & Kraft corporate umbrella. ''It would be futile, certainly in a cultural sense, to try to make one company out of Dart & Kraft,'' he said. ''We want to preserve the identity and autonomy of these separate businesses.''\n\nThe other five were already independent divisions in the Dart structure: Tupperware, P.R. Mallory (Duracell batteries), consumer products (West Bend appliances and cookware), Thatcher Glass and chemicals and plastics. ''We are moving to an organization that looks more like Dart -heterogenous and decentralized - than Kraft,'' Mr. Richman said.\n\nOrganization specialists say clashing policies often are ignored after a merger. But eventually, if they are not addressed, they lead to power struggles that undermine the advantages sought through the combination.\n\nWilliam T. Gregor, a consultant at the Management Analysis Center in Cambridge, Mass., said executives typically must also determine who will receive what information, and how much importance will be attached to it.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of William E.

Illustrated. 224 pp. New York: A & W Publishers. $29.95 until Jan. 1, 1982; $35 thereafter.\n\nREVEALING ILLUSTRATIONS The Art of James McMullan. Introductory Interview by Milton Glaser. Illustrated. 143 pp. New York: Watson-Guptill Publications. $27.50.\n\nNORMAN ROCKWELL'S PEOPLE By Susan E. Meyer. Illustrated. 242 pp. New York: Harry N. Abrams. $40.\n\nNEARLY a century ago, Henry James pondered ''the failure of caricature to achieve, as yet, a high destiny in America.'' He offered the explanation that ''a society has to be old before it becomes critical, and it has to become critical before it can take pleasure in the reproduction of its incongruities.'' If Steven Heller's ''Man Bites Man'' accom plishes little else, it provides persuasive evidence that, graphically speaking, the country has come of age.\n\nHappily, though, Heller's is a refreshingly personal selection of satiric art from the past two decades. It presents a cosmopolitan mix (11 Americans, 11 Europeans) of veteran illustrators (Robert Osborn, Ronald Searle, Andre Francois), mature graphic gadflies (Jules Feiffer, Paul Flora, Jean-Jacques Sempe, Tomi Ungerer) and latter-day luminaries (David Levine, Ed Koren, Hans Georg Rauch, Gahan Wilson). The collection has been intelligently organized as a series of mini-portfolios, each containing seven to nine mostly choice offerings by a single artist; this arrangement allows the viewer an unrushed opportunity to savor every contributor's style and sensibility -from bittersweet to savage. Conspicuously absent is any female cartoonist, an omission for which the editor can hardly be faulted. Since Helen Hokinson's retirement, the field has been strictly a male preserve.\n\nSomehow, Heller's choices manage to escape the potentially corrosive effects of passing time, particularly on topical political and social satire. R.O. Blechman's inspired conceit of transforming the Statue of Liberty's multi-windowed crown into the ultimate McDonald's is as wickedly droll as it was in 1974. Edward Gorey's perverse little cautionary tale ''The Pious Infant'' remains as quaintly antediluvian as its author intended in 1966. (Gorey, whose best work is book-length, is a curious inclusion. Though two of his arcane picture stories are reprinted, they lose a good deal by not appearing in their familiar small format.) If the Americans George Booth and Lou Myers are the slapstick clowns of the group, then the German Hans Georg Rauch, with his baroque architectonics, and the Rumanian-born Eugene Mihaesco, with his limpid cartoon paintings, are its beaux arts delegates.\n\nIn general, the Europeans are subtler satirists, more caring of technique and draftsmanship. They are also conspicuously less dependent on verbal accompaniment, either captions or word balloons. Sempe might be speaking for most of his Continental confreres when he says, ''More and more I want to do drawings where nothing happens, without gags, without justification.'' Of course, both Levine and Osborn can hold their own in this company. Levine's ''Mussolini'' is a marvel of elegant economy; and Osborn's masterly back view of Nixon, a sullied politico with bloodied arms raised in a V for Victory, is as timeless in its fine moral outrage as a page from Goya's ''Disasters of War.''\n\nThere is one bone to pick with Mr. Heller, who is also art director of The New York Times Book Review: His perceptive introductory appreciations to each artist's work often omit such mundane factual details as the man's birthplace and age, which would have been welcome. Nonetheless, any viewer will come away with a richer understanding of an art form in which wit, attentiveness to the human comedy and a mysterious ability to make pen and pencil exquisitely responsive to cerebral stimuli combine in wondrously varied ways to make life more bearable for us all.\n\nFor anyone contemplating a career in - or simply curious about - commercial art, there is unlikely to be a more honest or authoritative guide than James McMullan's ''Revealing Illustrations.'' Not only is the author an experienced advertising, magazine, record-cover and theatrical-poster artist, as well as the winner of several graphic-arts awards, he also teaches professional illustrators at New York's School of Visual Arts.\n\nBoth candid and introspective, McMullan pinpoints his moment of greatest professional enjoyment: ''It usually isn't finding the basic ingredients of the picture, the metaphor, the staging, and so forth, even though those things are often pleasurable. The high moment for me is some small turn that the image takes - often esthetic - which changes the image in some fundamental way for me. When it happens, I often feel that the image becomes mine.''\n\nMost valuable of all, the author takes his readers along with him on a variety of assignments. He makes us privy to his false starts and failures as well as his triumphs. Confessing to a penchant for ''using the grittiness of real life'' in his work, McMullan also allows it into his book. The result is an instructive and highly readable profile of an honorable profession.\n\nThough it might appear that little is left to say about Norman Rockwell after four previous, lavishly illustrated books from Harry N. Abrams, the very publisher of Susan E. Meyer's ''Norman Rockwell's People,'' the author has ingeniously come up with a new wrinkle. By visiting New Rochelle, N.Y., Arlington, Vt., and Stockbridge, Mass. - the towns where Rockwell spent his adult life - she has succeeded in identifying and providing snapshots of some 140 relatives, friends and neighbors who posed for the artist. Of those still living, she interviewed 45.\n\nMiss Meyer's quest has yielded several oblique insights into Rockwell's rigid way of painting. In much the same way a cartoonist develops the image for a sight gag, Rockwell would picture in his mind's eye a storytelling scene, one likely to evoke nostalgic thoughts of small-town virtues and the good old days. Once he had a likely subject, he set to work staging the scene, dressing friends and neighbors in appropriate costumes, placing them in a carefully selected setting and then photographing them.\n\nThe artist would paint only what was actually before his eyes. When, for instance, an octogenarian neighbor's mustache seemed de trop, Rockwell induced him to shave it instead of simply imagining what the subject might look like without it. Finally Rockwell would select the most effective photograph and make a small charcoal sketch from it. The sketch would be projected onto his canvas for the final painting. Occasionally Rockwell would summon a new model if a face or form seemed not quite perfect. But always, the real thing had to be there in front of him before he took brush in hand.\n\nRockwell's mind's eye could not see beyond what he called ''happy sadness.'' No hint of the Great Depression or the darker moments of World War II ever crept into his pictures. None interviewed by Miss Meyer had anything but good to say of the artist. The only comment with bite was made by his son Peter: ''My father believed that the truth was interesting only so long as it didn't disturb a good story.''\n\nIllustrations: cartoon by Lou Mayers from 'Man Bites Man'",

SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL\n\nPerforming in a musical ensemble, whether jazz or classical, requires fine musicianship and produces a textured and subtle music genre. Listening to small ensembles, in this instance chamber-music groups, is one of the less vigorous activities in Central Park on Sundays. At noon tomorrow, in the Dairy, the Springstead Woodwind Quintet will perform music by Jan Pieters Sweelinck, Paul Taffanel, Malcolm Arnold, John Lennon and Irving Fine.\n\nThe quintet is made up of Wendy Rolfe, flutist; Joel Timm, oboist; Chris Soder, clarinetist; Constance Wells, bassoonist, and Robert Abernathy, French-horn player.\n\nThe free concert begins at noon at 65th Street between the zoo and the carousel.

It is ''Emma Mae Pearson: The First Colored Woman to Appear on the Air.'' This story is set at the rehearsal of a minstrel show outside East St. Louis. The veteran actress Estelle Evans plays Emma Mae Pearson, and the cast includes Leeta Harris, James Pickens Jr., Earl Aremis Johnson Jr., Delphine P. Lester and Tim Battle, who also directs. James Edward Shannon, who wrote the play, comes from a theaterical family. Laura Finnie, his mother, was an actress at the black-owned Indiana theater in Chicago, and Willy Shannon, his father, was a Baptist preacher.

        "instruction": "The Fed’s most vocal hawk questioned the now-popular notion that the U.S. economy faces a deflationary bust.\n\nThomas Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, renewed his call for the Fed to end its promises to hold down interest rates.\n\nHe said in a speech Friday that the Fed’s promise to keep its short-term interest rate target near zero isn’t aiding the economic recovery, which he contends is stronger than commonly believed.\n\n“In fact, we are experiencing a better pace of recovery this time than at this point in our previous two economic recoveries,” Hoenig said. “The current recovery in its first year saw GDP grow an average of 3.2%. The GDP growth rate for the 1991 recovery was 2.61%; and for the 2001 recovery, it was 1.92%.”\n\nWhat’s more, Hoenig said, the promise to keep short-term interest rates near zero risks “inadvertently adding to ‘uncertainty’” that tends to reduce consumption and business investment.\n\nIt also puts the Fed on the path to repeating the errors it made in the last recovery, when then Chairman Alan Greenspan kept the fed funds rate at 1% even as the economy expanded at high single-digit rates, he said.\n\nThe remarks come as policymakers grapple with persistently high unemployment and popular frustration that the economic rebound hasn’t been stronger.\n\n“There may be ways to accelerate GDP growth, but in my view, highly expansionary monetary policy is not a good option,” Hoenig said. “Remember, high interest rates did not cause the financial crisis or the recession.”\n\nThe comments come days after the Fed, expressing growing concern about the economic outlook, unveiled a plan to buy more Treasury bonds with the proceeds of maturing mortgage bonds. The Fed did so to make sure that the money supply wouldn’t start contracting at a time when cash-strapped states are cutting spending to close their budget gaps.\n\nThat plan, together with Fed chief Ben Bernanke’s remark last month that the economic outlook is “unusually uncertain,” pushed investors out of riskier assets like stocks and into the safety of U.S. government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has dropped as low as 2.7%, from 4% just four months ago.\n\nThe plunge has amplified worries that the economy is stumbling into a period of deflation, marked by a falling price level that increases consumers’ debt burden.\n\nBut Hoenig noted that news reports were full of similar claims in the early stages of the last recovery, and said a look at the consumer price index over time should allay fears about price declines.\n\nThe consumer price index was a mere 18 in 1945 but was 172 at the start of this century. Today, despite our most recent crisis, the CPI is over 219. Not once during more than half a century has the index systematically declined. I find no evidence that deflation is the most serious threat to the recovery today.\n\nHoenig stressed that he isn’t calling for an interest-rate rise now. Instead, he recommends that the Fed drop its promise to keep rates low for an extended period and then begin raising rates as the recovery picks up steam.\n\nHoenig, who is one of the 10 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, has been making that case for some time, to no apparent avail.\n\nHoenig also warned that policymakers, while recognizing the risks of surprising market players and leading to unrest, should be wary of giving traders a free pass, as he contends the Fed is doing now.\n\n“I wish free money was really free and that there was a painless way to move from severe recession and high leverage to robust and sustainable economic growth,” he said, “but there is no short cut.”",

However, it’s not easy, and you will find yourself revisiting levels to complete challenges like finding hidden items.\n\nI can’t find much to criticize in this game, apart from how much time it may eat up.\n\nAlso, be careful of the in-app purchases if you give it to your children to play, because those purchases can cost up to $20.\n\nThe nudity in the game is definitely cartoonish and should be of the safe-for-work variety in most cases.\n\nFree on iOS or Android\n\nFor a more winter-sportslike game that may remind you of the fabulous snowboarding game SSX on gaming consoles, try out “Crazy Snowboard,” free on iOS or Android.\n\nThis pseudosimulation game places you in control of a snowboarder navigating a downhill terrain peppered with obstacles and jumps.\n\nYou steer your phone in the air to make turns and tap on the screen to spin or do tricks like grabbing your snowboard in any one of a number of impressive ways.\n\nThe game has 3-D graphics, engaging music and sounds, and such extras as changeable boards and snowsuits.\n\nThere are several playing modes, like free play or mission-based downhill runs, to keep your interest.\n\nAs you earn more points, you can buy more outfits or more impressive tricks.\n\nHowever, amusing as the game is, it lacks some of the compelling sizzle you might expect if you’ve played a console skiing or boarding game, partly because you travel the slopes alone with no other players to race (or crash) against.\n\nThe full “pro” versions ($2 on iOS and $1.03 on Android) do have more content, including more outfits, tricks, and missions, and this may account for why the game is so popular on both platforms.\n\nFree on Android and iOS\n\nIf it’s a skiing game experience you’re after, then “Ski Challenge 14,” free on Android and iOS, is definitely one to try. This game has perhaps the most impressive graphics of the apps mentioned here. Playing it by rotating your phone, you almost get the sensation of skis biting into the snow to make tight turns.\n\nThere are several courses to choose from, though you have to qualify and race on them to unlock the later ones. There’s even a sense of competition, thanks to the online mode in which your live race times are compared with those of other players. But the game requires you set up a (free) account, and it’s designed to get you to buy in-app “coins” to upgrade your experience or repair skis, which have limited on-snow time. This can quickly get annoying.\n\nFinally, check out “Ski on Neon,” $1 on iOS, and “Stickman Snowboarder,” free on Android, for simple 2-D casual gaming. Both are games you’ll come back to again and again.\n\nOh, don’t forget to go outside, too! Winter really isn’t that bad.",

        "instruction": "Once relegated to basements and left-over spaces, employee eating facilities are being given greater prominence in many new office buildings in the city and the suburbs.\n\n''It's becoming more and more the case for major corporations to address themselves to providing an improved working environment,'' said John J. Kaiser, senior vice president of Cushman & Wakefield, a leasing, sales and management organization. Such concerns, he continued, ''include almost by necessity a comfortable eating facility with reasonable rates,'' and even recreational and cultural facilities, ''after-hours bars,'' and possibly day-care centers for workers' young children.\n\nOne key reason is the competition for back-office personnel. The corporate cafeteria, according to Jerry L. Cohen of Wm. A. White & Sons, has been a ''stepchild that used to be sandwiched into the back offices,'' but companies are beginning to treat their operations personnel with more ''dignity'' and provide them with more attractive facilities.\n\nJames F. Hutton, executive assistant to the chairman of A.R.A. Services, a Philadelphia-based company that is one of the world's largest food-service organizations, said that ''more and more attention is being paid to the eating environment in offices and factories with more color'' and breaks with monotomy. Mr. Hutton said that most companies tended to follow industry patterns rather than independent approaches to the problem and that some industries, such as pharmaceuticals and insurance, were more ''benevolent'' than others, such as the automobile industry.\n\nCorporate concern with feeding employees dates at least to the Middle Ages in England, Mr. Hutton declared, and in this country it became important in the Industrial Revolution, with the formation at the start of this century of companies to provide food services to other companies.\n\nWhile companies have long recognized that internal eating facilities can eliminate or cut back on lunch excursions and possibly improve productivity, corporate cafeterias, as distinct from much smaller executive dining rooms, have been generally utilitarian and institutional.\n\nMany companies located in central business districts have not felt obliged to provide cafeterias. A major exception, Mr. Hutton noted, has been the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which serves thousands of free meals daily from an elaborate complex in two basements of its Manhattan headquarters at Madison and 24th Street. One of the most elaborate company food facilities, it is extensively decorated with murals commissioned primarily during the Depression from such famous artists as N.C. Wyeth.\n\nCafeterias became a much more important employee amenity when companies moved to the suburbs and to isolated campus settings in which the workers were ''captive.''\n\nThe new facilities tend to emphasize diversity of menu, colors and seating and lounging arrangements rather than the traditional linear layout and chrome and vinyl furnishings.\n\nSome cafeterias have become the spectacular focal design point of major new buildings such as the Irving Trust Operations Center, now under construction in lower Manhattan, and the American Telephone & Telegraph Company building in Basking Ridge, N.J.\n\nThe cafeteria in the new 23-story Irving Trust building designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill will occupy the top of the east side of the building, which is divided by a blocklong atrium.\n\nThe 1,000-seat cafeteria will be 200 feet above the lobby, overlooking an atrium on the west and the city's skyline in the other directions through clerestory windows. Slanting trusses, which were originally designed to be exposed on the roof, frame the interior space of the 300-foot-long cafeteria and lounge space.\n\nThe space has 30- to 60-foot ceiling heights and it will be forested not only with trees, but also with 30 air-conditioning and heating pylons. The pylons, which will be about 10 feet high and 2 feet 3 inches in diameter, will circulate tempered air where it is needed.\n\nDavid Santos, a bank spokesman, said a well-designed cafeteria was a part of a strategy to ''assist in attracting and keeping the highly skilled person who will staff the operations center.''\n\nHe said that the bank wanted to create a restful, park-like area for the employees because the building's location had been undeveloped for about 15 years and there were few regular dining facilities in the neighborhood and fewer still that were open for all its shifts. Mr. Santos said that the cafeteria, which will not be open to the public, would serve employees almost around the clock.\n\nAt the sprawling A.T.&T. facility in Basking Ridge, Vincent Kling, the architect, designed a varied, lofty space with a multitude of seating arrangements and two-story fireplaces. Observing that ''brown-baggers kind of quit a long time ago,'' Mr. Kling said that he endeavored to ''eliminate the military chow hall where even the best food tastes bad and to create an environment of diversity and interest where even a modest sandwich and a glass of milk taste better.''",

This museum has finally settled into new quarters that could not be more fitting for its purpose. It is on the mezzanine floor of the Federal Hall National Memorial, at 26 Wall Street, corner of Broad, and its current exhibition, ''Lower Manhattan from Street to Sky,'' is hung in four recently restored rooms connected by a walkway that gives a dramatic view of the building's rotunda.\n\nThe show, through April 30, is no less apropos to the Downtown scene, an apotheosis of artistic perceptions of the world's most famous skyline, the one under which the museum itself has found a home. Here are 38 paintings, watercolors, drawing and prints by wellknown artists whose work spans the years from 1907 to present days and who drew inspiration from the region between Battery Park and the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nThe pieces constitute not only art but also a history of Downtown. William Glackens's ''Curb Exchange No. One,'' the oldest piece here, depicts the stock exchange when it was really on the curb, a heterogeneous crown dealing on the street. It is a far cry from Christo's ''Two Lower Manhattan Wrapped Buildings (State St. and Broadway, 20 Exchange Place),'' done last year.\n\nHere are the Downtowns of Red Grooms (grotesque and funny), of John Marin (catches the movement if not the photographic reproduction), of Reginald Marsh (the scene, with feeling), and of all those others, among them George Bellows, Richard Haas, Robert Indiana, Max Weber.\n\nOpen free from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. Mondays through Fridays. Information: 431-1621. UPPER WHITNEY\n\nThe Whitney, at its main base at Madison Avenue and East 75th Street (570-3600), is paying homage to John Cage, the avant-garde music maker, in three concerts at 7:30 P.M. today through Friday. This recognizes Mr. Cage's 70th birthday, an age at which his garde is no less avant than it was in the 50 earlier years of his career.\n\nThe concerts, performed by the S.E.M. Ensemble, directed by Petr Kotik, will make manifest the Cage influence on current music by presenting several works that he has created since 1957. Today's concert will offer the first complete performance of his ''Song Books, I, II,'' a 1970 work that involves 92 voice solos on 317 pages of score, with and without electronic modulation, and with theater pieces, done by 16 musicians.\n\nAdmission: $5. Audiences will also be able to see in the lobby gallery the current exhibition, ''John Cage: Scores and Prints.'' HEAVENLY DAYS\n\nAll the stars were not receiving Oscars this week. A number are just hanging out in the heavens, and that is why the Amateur Astronomers Association is inviting you to look at them from 7:30 to 10 P.M. tonight under its auspices on the front lawn of the Hayden Planetarium, at West 81st Street and Central Park West.\n\nThe catch phrase here is ''weather permitting.'' If the sky is more than half covered by clouds at 2 P.M., the affair is canceled. Otherwise, contrary to the general idea that New York is too bright for stars to shine through clearly, you should be able to see the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Pleiades and the Hyades. The association will have half a dozen telescopes on hand for you to get close-ups. A $1 donation will be appreciated. Information: 535-2922.\n\nIf the live stars are blotted out by weather, the heavens will go on as scheduled in the Planetarium itself, which on Wednesdays has a late show at 7:30 P.M. The show, through Aug. 25, is ''Stars of the Season'' and is now showing seven days a week at 1:30 and 3:30 P.M. Admission: $3.25; students and over-65's, $2.25; 2-to-12's, $1.50.

        "output": "LOWER WHITNEY   For several years, the Whitney Museum of American Arts has had a downtown branch, in several locations, that is designed to reveal the arts to the financial people in lower Manhattan. This museum has finally settled into new quarters that could not be more fitting for its purpose. It is on the mezzanine floor of the Federal Hall National Memorial, at 26 Wall Street, corner of Broad, and its current exhibition, ''Lower Manhattan from Street to Sky,'' is hung in four recently restored rooms connected by a walkway that gives a dramatic view of the building's rotunda.   The show, through April 30, is no less apropos to the Downtown scene, an apotheosis of artistic perceptions of the world's most famous skyline, the one under which the museum itself has found a home. Here are 38 paintings, watercolors, drawing and prints by wellknown artists whose work spans the years from 1907 to present days and who drew inspiration from the region between Battery Park and the Brooklyn Bridge."

        "instruction": "Thanks to recent, additional purchases of property on Madison Avenue, the Whitney Museum of American Art now owns the entire blockfront on the east side of Madison Avenue between 74th and 75th Streets, with some frontage on 74th Street. The purchases have given rise to reports that the Whitney is considering the addition of a hotel or apartment complex to its present six-story building, opened in 1966.\n\nBut Tom Armstrong, the Whitney's director, denies that the museum has imminent expansion plans. ''No decision has been made on whether to develop the property, how to develop it and whether or not we are capable of raising the funds to develop it,'' Mr. Armstrong said. He stressed, however, the Whitney's need for space for full-scale exhibition of its permanent collection of American art, impossible in the present building.\n\n''Our trustees and staff have decided that presentation of the permanent collection should become the major focus of our activities, rather than temporary exhibitions,'' he said. ''Obviously, we must have increased facilities if we wish to show the permanent collection and continue our temporary exhibition program.'' A Comprehensive Survey\n\nThe Whitney's permanent collection of more than 2,000 objects provides one of the most comprehensive surveys of American art in the world. Starting next fall, in an effort to dramatize the need for expanded facilities, the museum will sacrifice its temporary exhibition space on the third floor, installing 100 works from the permanent collection for a five-year period.\n\nMr. Armstrong said there was no truth to reports that the Whitney was considering the kind of arrangement adopted by the Museum of Modern Art; i.e., the sale of air rights to a developer who would then build a condominium apartment house or hotel with facilities for the expanded museum. ''Nothing is possible unless major funds can be raised,'' he said, ''and there's no indication at the present time that we can do it.''\n\nObservers point out that unlike the Modern, which has been heavily supported by the Rockefeller family, the Whitney - founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in 1930 - cannot call on any major single source to provide ''leadership'' funds for a capital campaign. A National Committee Set Up\n\nIn an effort to emphasize what it sees as its national role, and draw support from outside New York, the Whitney last year established a national committee, composed of members from all over the country who are closely identified in their communities with American art. So far, the committee has 42 members, who pay $2,000 in annual dues. The money will be used for circulating exhibitions, the first of which, ''Art of the 1930's,'' will begin its tour next fall.\n\nMeanwhile, the Whitney is expanding in other areas. In addition to its existing downtown branch, currently situated in the former First Precinct Police Station on Old Slip, it will open next year a midtown branch, a ground-floor sculpture garden at the new Philip Morris corporate headquarters building at Park Avenue and 42d Street. The glass-enclosed space, 42 feet high and a block long, will give the museum a chance to exhibit large-scale sculpture pieces not easily accommodated in its present building.\n\nNext May, the Whitney will branch out to the suburbs, opening a ''major'' exhibition facility in the new Stamford, Conn., headquarters of the Champion International Corporation, producers of lumber, building materials and paper products. The new Stamford facility is the first suburban branch of a major New York museum. It is also thought to mark the first time an industrial corporation has enhanced its premises - and its image - by physically incorporating an outside, nonprofit art facility.\n\nIn 1979, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston branched into rent-free space in the Quincy Market restoration, provided by the Rouse Corporation, the market's developers. But that was for a stated 2 1/2-year period, while the museum built a new wing (to open next July). A Two-Story Gallery Planned\n\nIn Stamford, the Whitney will occupy 2,500 square feet, rent-free, on the ground floor of the Champion building. A two-story gallery, surrounded on all four sides by glass walls topped with glass blocks, has been designed by Ulrich Franzen, who as architect for the Champion and the Philip Morris buildings, suggested the idea. Each corporation has a long relationship with the Whitney as a sponsor of exhibitions, and each will provide financial support for its new onsite Whitney facility, under a contract running for five years.\n\nFor the Whitney, the benefits of its new corporate facilities in Stamford include a chance to broaden its audience at small cost, pick up new members (and possible donors), and expand sales from museum shops. Mr. Armstrong sees the new sponsorship as ''a further indication that corporations are truly interested in supporting cultural institutions,'' and points out that in both cases the museum will have full control of its programs.\n\nSpeaking for Champion, Richard W. Lowry, senior vice president, said, ''We believe the exhibition gallery will benefit the museum, our company and, most important, the citizens of Fairfield County.'' The new gallery will be open free, Tuesdays through Saturdays, presenting at least six shows a year, plus performances, films and lectures.",

        "instruction": "IT was 1953, and Paris was inexpensive and romantic, and it was possible then, as it had been possible in Hemingway's time, to make writing not only a vocation but an entire way of life. And so a group of young Americans went to Paris, where they wrote and drank and played tennis and sat up all night at cafes, and where they started a little magazine that ran on talent and enthusiasm and a youthful joie de vivre.\n\nThat was many years ago, and The Paris Review is now celebrating its silver anniversary with a special birthday issue, which includes a previously unpublished essay on ''The Art of Writing Short Stories'' by Ernest Hemingway, an interview with Rebecca West, an unpublished ghost story by William Faulkner, poetry by John Ashbery, Robert Creeley, James Dickey, John Hollander, Anne Sexton and Philip Levine, as well as an acerbic letter to the editor from Martha Gellhorn that takes on Lillian Hellman and Stephen Spender for their statements about her and her former husband, Ernest Hemingway. A birthday party is also planned for this summer.\n\nThe magazine, which has always prided itself on a kind of laissezfaire good will, has never been known for the punctuality of its appearance, and this anniversary issue is no exception. As its editor, George Plimpton, points out, the Review is actually celebrating its 28th year of publication, but because its 25th year somehow ''slid by without anyone raising any hoopla,'' he simply decided to ''designate another year.''\n\nAnyway, the exact dates don't really seem to matter. Little magazines are notoriously short-lived - its competitor Merlin, for instance, folded after half a dozen issues - and The Paris Review's survival beyond two decades remains something of a remarkable achievement indeed.\n\n''It's terrible to think one's been operating 28 years, getting out a publication with only six or seven or eight thousand subscribers,'' said Mr. Plimpton. ''It's the bleachers in Wrigley Field. But after five or 10 years, you almost have an obligation to go on. You get an extraordinary backlog of material - a great novella, a wonderful interview -that you want to share with your public. And besides, I think the magazine's really filled a gap.''\n\nIn fact, when the magazine was founded in Paris by Peter Matthiessen and Harold Humes, it represented something of a radical departure in the little magazine tradition. While its precursors and rivals tended to devote themselves to engage political treatises and all manner of critical essays, The Review willfully avoided words\n\nJP 2d SUB SILVER/C14 like zeitgeist and architectonic, and went about trying to publish the finest poetry and fiction of new and established writers. It was among the first to publish such then-newcomers as Philip Roth, Terry Southern, Hughes Rudd, George Steiner and V.S. Naipaul, and the first to publish Samuel Beckett in America.\n\nSome of these writers were acquaintances of the editors; others just seemed to collect around the magazine, showing up at the Cafe de Tournon or Le Chaplain or at Mr. Matthiessen's sunny Montparnasse apartment.\n\n''There was a great deal of energy and buoyancy in those days,'' recalls William Styron, an early friend of the magazine. ''It was as if all of us were trying to recapture the postwar period when Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Stein were there. People like Alice B. Toklas and Tristan Tzara were still living, and there was a distinct link with the past. I don't think we were intimidated by it, but we were going to recreate their accomplishment on our own terms. We were plainly all fledglings then - we had not yet come into our own.''\n\nAnimated by a kind of collegiate irreverence perfected by its Yale- and Harvard-educated editors, The Review soon became a requisite stopping-off point for other bright young Americans who were spending their postgraduate days abroad.\n\nIndeed, so many volunteers came and went through its office on the Rue Garanciere that they were soon given collective names: women were called, for some curious reason, ''Apotheckers,'' after the German word for pharmacist; their male counterparts, ''Musinskys,'' after the first of their kind, a Frank Musinsky. Over the years, the Apotheckers came to include Jane Fonda, Lena Horne's daughter Gail Jones and Frances FitzGerald.\n\nMost of the Apotheckers, Musinskys and editors lived frugally on the Left Bank, but they never seemed to want for money or entertainment. There were trips to Spain to run with the bulls; visits to Irwin Shaw in the South of France; and invitations to the Quat'zart balls, those risque costume parties given by French art students.\n\nThe staff's Parisian acquaintances were no less amusing, including a poet who tried to drown himself in the precise manner set down in a Beckett story; a painter who cut open a vein in his leg so as to finish his last masterpiece in his own blood; and a very elegant woman - she later married the magazine's publisher Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan - who used to walk her pet black panther on a leash.",

        "instruction": "You might have the urge to jump into the first painting in “Leidy Churchman: Lazy River” at the Boston University Art Gallery at the Stone Gallery. “Pool” lies on the floor just inside the entrance, a giant, shimmery abstraction in blues, greens, and blacks, nearly filling the gallery floor. It’s the clarion opening note in a gorgeously orchestrated exhibition.\n\nChurchman uses color, language, a variety of styles, and video to remind us how painting corresponds to our bodies, and how it twines our bodies to our imaginations. Paint is like the messy stuff of an inner life, organized and expressed into something meaningful by the bodily action of painting.\n\n“Pool” invites immersion. In one corner, a quarter moon gleams softly, suggesting a reflection. Depth and surface, viscerally evoked. The painting beckons the eye, and the whole body.\n\nPaintings of graves appear throughout, in a faux-naive style in dusky, late-summer greens, flaring reds, and sooty grays. The artist places us at the foot of each grave, looking down. The rectangle of the grave becomes a screen for our projections, darker and more mortal than the watery delights we cast onto “Pool.” Pool, grave, painting — all screens for our own dreams, fears, and longing.\n\nThe graves, painted with juicy hues in a manner that simplifies shapes, move toward abstraction. Form and color carry their own implicit emotional meanings. Several smaller paintings throughout the show flit like moths from picture’s concrete message to abstraction’s subtler codes. A deep, marshy green recurs, like a touchstone, in seemingly straightforward paintings such as “Ambulance” and “Pizza Box.” The color feels tidal, tugging us under.\n\n“Lazy River,” a suite of several paintings propped cheek by jowl on a low bench, looks up at the viewer like expectant parishioners in a church pew. They chat intimately among themselves. Many are abstract, vaguely geometric, echoes of color field painting. One depicts a seagull. Another is a smudgy, smoky black aura. That slow, deep green seethes throughout, a bass note to the rhythms of black, white, and the brown, naked linen of the paintings.\n\nChurchman digitally records details of paintings as he moves paint over them — a callback to action painting. His video “The Field” intersperses such images (including one where he pushes soil up the painting, chillingly bringing us right back to the grave’s edge) with scenes from nature. It’s a montage, like “Lazy River,” every image building on the next. A seascape fades into the fog. A robin sits in the grass, listening. Between these cuts, the monitor goes black.\n\nLovely and lulling, “The Field” is another screen, across which plays art history, surface and depth, color and gesture, personal associations. It’s an incubator for looking — which, as Churchman compellingly reminds us, is not a passive act, but a dynamically receptive one.\n\nJohn Cederquist’s remarkable wooden chairs and trays at Gallery NAGA come at looking and making from a different angle. Cederquist, a wizard of technique, riddles with perception. Making pictures with marquetry — that is, wood inlays — he creates 3-D illusions on objects that are already three-dimensional. “Architectural Elements” is a functional chair, but it just as much resembles a scrap heap of architectural throwaways. Anyone might be afraid to sit on it.\n\nThree two-by-fours zigzag improbably up the back and don’t appear to fasten together. One leg looks like a plaster cornice. An arm appears to have dropped onto the seat. A striped length of fabric drapes over the whole thing – only it’s not fabric. It’s wood inlay. The effect boggles eye and mind.\n\nCederquist plays fewer perceptual games in his trays; they’re simpler illustrations of his mastery. He dyes the wood he uses for the inlays for color effect. “Kegani & Green Tea” does prod at 3-D — he uses marquetry to suggest a rim, which is not actually there. The rest is pure picture: a crab on a plate, a small cup of tea — every detail rich.\n\nGarry Knox Bennett’s lamps, on view in the back room at NAGA, go well alongside Cederquist’s chairs. The artist uses clean form and humor, so when the lights go on they inevitably suggest inspiration. In “Paintbrush,” a flame-shaped bulb sprouts from the end of a brush, which angles diagonally toward a truncated pyramid platform, where it musses with yellow paint.\n\nThen there’s the third solo show at NAGA, Mary Kocol’s color photos of flowers frozen in ice. They’re strangely exuberant, given ice’s implications, from climate change to deep freeze. Light pours through, the blossoms retain their vibrancy, and the bubbles and streaks in the ice read like celebration.\n\n“Morning Glory With Bubble” depicts a translucent, wide-open purple bloom with a bubble suspended just above it, as if the flower has just exhaled. A green leaf hangs to the right, like a stage curtain opening to the vivid scene, and blue sky can be glimpsed in the background. More bubbles — tiny, champagne-sized orbs, silvery white — rush all around, adding to the sense that this moment is not frozen at all. It’s fleeting.\n\nJOHN CEDERQUIST: Indecision of Upholstery GARRY KNOX BENNETT: Just Some Lamps\n\nMARY KOCOL: Ice Gardens: The Poetics of Nature\n\n67 Newbury St., through Sept. 28. 617-267-9060, www.gallerynaga.com",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, March 2— The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether Federal limits on campaign financing allow the national political parties to assume some of the fund-raising authority that Congress placed in the hands of the state party organizations.\n\nThe case finds the Democratic and Republican national organizations on opposite sides, taking positions that reflect the disparity in their ability to raise money for Congressional races.\n\nThe Federal Election Campaign Act established separate spending authorities for the national and state political organizations. Each organization is allowed to spend at least $200,000 in a United States Senate race, with maximum allowable amounts tied to state populations.\n\nThe question in the case accepted by the Court today is whether the state party organizations, which frequently are unable to raise as much money as they are legally entitled to spend, can ''assign'' their spending authority to the national organizations. Issue Technical, but Important\n\nThe issue is highly technical, but of considerable practical importance. Last year, the National Republican Senatorial Committee entered into arrangements with several Republican state committees to assume their fund-raising authority. The arrangements increased the national committee's spending authority by about $2 million.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which had no such arrangements, complained to the Federal Election Commission that the Republicans were violating the campaign law. The six-member commission dismissed the Democrats' complaint, and the Democrats appealed to the Federal District Court here.\n\nThe District Court upheld the election commission, but on Oct. 9 the United States Court of Appeals reversed the decision and held that the arrangements violated the law. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger granted a last-minute stay of the decision, so the 1980 national elections were unaffected. Both the election commission and the Republicans appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Republicans told the Justices that the Court of Appeals had mistakenly decided ''that it is somehow 'unfair' for the National Republican Senatorial Committee to engage in effective political fund raising and advocacy when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has been unable, through its own efforts, to render equally effective services to Democratic candidates.''\n\nThe case, Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, No. 80-939, gives the Court the opportunity to decide how much deference the Federal courts should pay to the Federal Election Commission in its day-to-day administration of the election laws.\n\nAmong other Supreme Court actions today were these: Immigration Law\n\nIn an unsigned opinion joined by six Justices, the Court reversed a ruling by a Federal appeals court that had ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to reopen deportation proceedings for a Korean couple who have overstayed their visa by 11 years.\n\nDeportation of the couple was ordered in 1974, but numerous appeals delayed the process. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit last June ordered the immigration service to grant the couple another hearing to see if they qualified for an ''extreme hardship'' suspension of deportation proceedings. The Supreme Court agreed, in today's opinion, I.N.S. v. Wang, No. 80-485, said that the Court of Appeals ''improvidently encroached'' on the authority of the Attorney General to decide when a particular case constituted such ''extreme hardship.'' Prayer on Highway Map\n\nThe Court refused to hear an appeal by the State of North Carolina on a Federal appeals court ruling that the ''Motorist's Prayer,'' printed on the official state highway map, was an unconstitutional ''establishment'' of religion by the state.\n\nThe prayer, printed on the state maps since 1964, asks the blessings of ''our heavenly Father as we take the wheel of our car.'' A group of citizens brought a suit in 1975 and lost in the United States District Court. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decision, holding that the prayer was an impermissible government sponsorhip of religion. In its appeal, Bradshaw v. Hall, No. 80-746, the state argued that the prayer was no more offensive than the nondenominational invocation common at public meetings. Lawyer's Immunity\n\nThe Court agreed to decide whether a public defender can be sued for violating the constitutional rights of an indigent client. The case is an appeal by Polk County, Iowa, and its public defenders office from a ruling that the defender could be sued and was entitled to no more than a ''qualified'' immunity, in contrast to the absolute immunity that judges and prosecutors are given in similar situations.\n\nThe defender in the case, Polk County v. Dodson, No. 80-824, asked the state supreme court to dismiss as frivolous her client's appeal from a robbery conviction. The client sued on the ground that the action had deprived him of his constitutional right to counsel. The Federal District Court dismissed the suit, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reinstated it.",

        "instruction": "The largest public pension in Texas won’t back up its big talk.\n\nThree months ago, The Teacher Retirement System of Texas announced that it had selected Apollo Global Management APO and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR to each manage $3 billion. It was a huge announcement, with many believing that it could lead to a realignment of relationships between large public pension systems and top private equity firms.\n\nHere was the basic value proposition: The private equity firms each would get to boost their assets under management by $3 billion, with a single stroke of the pen. That’s a big deal for any firm, but of particular import for publicly-traded shops like Apollo and KKR. In exchange for its up-front largesse, TRS would receive certain concessions on fund fees and other investment-related expenses.\n\nFast forward to today: We know that the private equity firms have gotten their commitments. But we have no idea what term concessions, if any, TRS has received.\n\nThis is important, because such long-term agreements actually can result in higher-than-normal fees if not executed properly. For example, imagine that TRS agreed to pay 80 basis points in annual management fees and 15% carried interest on its commitments. Both are below-market terms (usually 200bp and 20%), but certain recycling provisions could mean that TRS would actually pay around $4.5 billion in fees over a 15-year period (based on a 15% annual return and no provision excluding fee payments on uncommitted capital).\n\nI’m not alleging that TRS struck a bad deal with Apollo and KKR. What I am saying, however, is that its silence on the matter is violating the spirit of transparency under which most public pension systems operate.\n\nTRS held a board meeting last November 4, in which it first disclosed the agreements with Apollo and KKR. Steve LeBlanc, a senior managing director of private markets at TRS, said that the agreements would be “ILPA-compliant.”\n\nFor the uninitiated, ILPA is a group of institutional investors in private equity (including TRS) that has developed a set of best practices to govern the LP-GP relationship. For example, ILPA principles suggest that all deal fees should accrue to limited partners. It also believes funds should feature a “waterfall” — which basically means limited partners get all of their drawn-down principal returned before general partners begin to collect carried interest. Many private equity firms have endorsed the ILPA principles, but very few adhere to each and every one of them.\n\nBut LeBlanc’s statement implied that both Apollo and KKR would, indeed, be in full compliance. So I emailed TRS communications director Howard Goldman, to make sure that LeBlanc had not misspoken. After a couple of days, Goldman told me that TRS could not comment because the agreements had not yet been executed. So I waited.\n\nThen KKR announced quarterly earnings last week, and announced that its deal with TRS was signed. So I emailed Goldman back, to see if the now-executed agreements were fully compliant with ILPA principles. After a couple of days of waiting, he sent the following:\n\nWait a minute. What on earth is “TRS-ILPA compliant?” Seems to be a pretty big qualifier, and now only “certain” ILPA terms apply? So I asked for additional clarification. What came back was kind of stunning:\n\nTRS might have adopted the ILPA guidelines, but apparently it’s applying its own secret version of them. Do as we say, not as we do.\n\nAnd I did look at the “Texas Way” document, which provides as much relevant information as a standard-issue chewing gum wrapper. Remember, it was TRS that first said it would be ILPA compliant. And it’s TRS staffers who go on business television networks, talking about how they’re fighting the good fight on private equity governance. But when you ask them to get specific, TRS hides behind bogus, self-constructed propriety.\n\nI called Goldman last night after receiving the aforementioned email. He said he was on his way out of the office, and that it was too late to talk (note: it was later in Boston, where I’m based). He suggested I ring “late morning” today. Upon doing so, I only received an email in reply, saying “Unfortunately, there is no one who can speak with you at this time.”\n\nGet Dan’s daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com",

        "instruction": "CHICAGO, Aug. 14— Pacemakers, designed to control the human heartbeat in patients with cardiac problems, are being implanted in some people who do not really need them, a new study suggests.\n\nAt one hospital where an effort was made to limit their use, pacemaker implantations were halved and the mortality rate substantially improved.\n\n''A lot of pacemakers are being implanted in patients who shouldn't have them,'' said Dr. Howard S. Friedman, a researcher at Brooklyn Hospital in New York, where a physicians' committee was established to review potential pacemaker cases.\n\n''Physicians need to be more critical about making a diagnosis that indicates implanting a pacemaker,'' he said. ''If they did this, they would implant fewer of them.''\n\nThe findings by Dr. Friedman and his colleagues were published in the Aug. 14 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, which has its headquarters here.\n\nPacemakers are small electronic devices implanted in the body and connected to the heart. They provide mild electric shocks to stimulate the heart muscles and make the organ beat regularly. Rising Trend of Implantations\n\nThe number of pacemaker implantations in the United States increased by about 9,000 a year from 1973 through 1978, to an estimated 85,000 last year, the report said.\n\nThe Brooklyn Hospital study was undertaken in part because of acceleration in pacemaker use there, from eight in 1972 to 48 in 1976.\n\nIn 1977, when the peer review committee was established, implantations dropped to 22 and remained there the following year. Before peer review, 57 percent of the patients receiving pacemakers were still alive three years later. After review, the figure jumped to 87 percent. Dr. Friedman said that was evidence that pacemakers had been given to patients for whom they did no good.\n\nHe said that some overuse was a result of shortcomings in medical knowledge. For example, in eight cases studied, patients taking a drug to lower blood pressure were given pacemakers because of slow heart rhythm. It was not known then that the drug could slow the rhythm.\n\nThe Brooklyn Hospital study is the second in recent years indicating overuse of the pacemakers. Earlier research at Harvard Medical School disclosed that 10 patients out of 32 studied did not need the units.",

At one hospital where an effort was made to limit their use, pacemaker implantations were halved and the mortality rate substantially improved.   ''A lot of pacemakers are being implanted in patients who shouldn't have them,'' said Dr. Howard S. Friedman, a researcher at Brooklyn Hospital in New York, where a physicians' committee was established to review potential pacemaker cases."

Dispatches received last night show the fulfilment of this expectation.\n\nMajor-Gen. GIO. H. THOMAS was sent to Louisville to organize the troops in his district, and drive FORREST from our lines, while the attention of Gen. SHERMAN was directed to the movements of the main rebel army in the vicinity of Atlanta.\n\nOn the 4th of October the rebels had captured Big Shanty, but were followed closely up by SHERMAN, on the 6th. A severe engagement was fought by our forces under Gen. FRENCH, in which the rebels were driven from the field with heavy loss, leaving their dead and wounded in our hands.\n\nDetails are given in the following dispatches from Gen. THOMAS:\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn., Thursday, Oct. 6 -- 11:30 P.M. Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War:\n\nThe following telegram is just received from Chattanooga:\n\nGen. SMITH, who left here yesterday, 5th inst., telegraphs that the enemy retreated last eveniing from Allatoona, moving in the direction of Dallas, leaving his dead and four to six hundred wounded in our hands. Our loss was about one hundred killed and two hundred wounded.\n\nThe Resaca bridge will be repaired by to-morrow, and the trains will be able to run as far as Allatoona, going via Cleveland and Dalton. Nothing further has been heard from SHERMAN since my dispatch of yesterday; but the retreat of the enemy toward Dallas indicates that he was close on their rear near Allatoona. I have not heard from Gens. ROUSSEAU or WASHBURNE to-day, but presume that they are pushing FORREST as rapidly as the condition of the roads will admit. We have had heavy and continuous rains for the last five days, rendering the roads and streams almost impassable. I have just received the following dispatch from Gen. GRANGER, dated Huntsville, 10 P.M., 6th: The courier reported drowned crossing the Elk River, is in. He lost the dispatches while crossing the river. He reports that two rebels were captured yesterday, who say that they left FORREST at Lawrenceburgh the night before crossing South. Gen. MORGAN's advance was skirmishing with the enemy this morning on Skive Creek, he being unable to cross the creek on account of high water. He hopes to be able to cross by to-morrow morning, when he will push him still further on. The Alabama Railroad will be repaired from here to Pulaski in one week.\n\nAnother and unofficial dispatch reports as follows:\n\n\"Telegraph repaired to Allatoona to-day. The action yesterday was severe. FRENCH attacking with his division, seven thousand strong, and suffering heavily, leaving his killed and wounded in our hands to the number of one thousand, while we lost only three hundred. The fight lasted six hours altogether. From Florence we hear that MORGAN has FORREST cornered, has captured his transportation, and that the gunboats prevent all retreat across the Tennessee.\"\n\nSatisfactory reports of the operations in progress before Richmond and Petersburgh have been received, but their details are not at present proper for publication.\n\nA dispatch from Gen. STEVENSON reports that an officer of Gen. SHERIDAN's Staff had just arrived. Gen. SHERIDAN was still at Harrisonburgh. His supply trains were going on all right, occasionally interrupted by guerrilla parties, the only rebel force on the road.\n\nThis officer brought in the remains of Lieut. JOHN R. MEIGS, of the Engineer Corps, the only son of Brevet Maj.-Gen. MEIGS, Quartermaster-General. He was killed by bushwhackers on Monday last, while making a military survey. In the death of this gallant young officer the department has occasion to deplore no ordinary loss. Last year he graduated at the Military Academy of West Point with the highest honors, at the head of his class. He was commissioned Lieutenant of Engineers, and immediately went into the field. He performed meritorious and distinguished services during the campaigns of last year on the fortifications at Baltimore, Harper's Ferry and Cumberland, and was made Chief of Engineers of the Army of the Shenandoah. In the campaigns he accompanied the army under SIGEL, HUNTER and SHERIDAN. In every position he gave proof of great professional skill, personal courage and devoted patriotism. One of the youngest and brightest ornaments of the military profession, he has fallen an early victim to the murderous rebel warfare.\n\nGen. ROSECRANS reports that Gen. EWING made good his retreat to Rolla, losing only a few [???] and those killed and wounded by the way, very few in number. From the number of the wounded rebels, the enemy's loss will not fall much short of [???],000 hors du combat. EDWIN M. STANTON.\n\nThe rebels have disappeared from Alatoona. Our victory there yesterday was complete. The rebel Surgeons surrendered their hospitals into our hands, with from four hundred to six hundred rebel wounded. Gen. CROSS was slightly wounded in the cheek; also, Col. ELLET, of the Fourth Minnesota in the thigh. An entire division attacked Alatoona, under FRENCH. Lieut. AMSDEN, of the Seventeenth Wisconsin Battery, lost a leg.",

Oh, once or twice a week she'll strip and dance for her dirty-minded stepfather and order up a severed head on a plate.\n\nThat's life off stage and on for the soprano Catherine Malfitano, who sings an acclaimed Salome in the current Metropolitan Opera production.\n\nMorphing into the twisted teen-age Terpsichore in Richard Strauss's telling of the horrific fable may seem a stretch for almost any diva in her 40's, not to mention one who last played the 337-year-old Emilia Marty in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's production of \"The Makropulos Affair.\"\n\nBut Ms. Malfitano, more than many of her professional kin, has made as much of a cause of staying fit as of pursuing an adventurous repertory. She reads \"Vegetarian Times\" and can tell tempeh from tofu. She knows her way around the health food markets of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and where to jog in Milan.\n\n\"I had to battle weight all through my life,\" she said while preparing a lunch of meatless chili and organic salad the other day in the large eat-in kitchen of her Riverside Drive apartment, where she lives with her husband and 9-year-old daughter when they are not in Chicago or on the road with her. \"If I'm not watching what I eat I could easily become a fat soprano.\"\n\nThe cliche notwithstanding, opera singers don't have to be overweight, she maintained. \"You're not resonating in your flabby thighs and midriff,\" she said. But singing too thin is no good either: \"I feel everything inside is going to collapse.\" (Ms. Malfitano, who stands just under 5 feet 4, said that at her heaviest, when pregnant, she weighed 180, but has since fluctuated between that and her bantamweight record of 114.)\n\nClearly, she has a lot to stay in shape for. As Salome, she has been drawing tumultuous ovations at the Met since the March 7 opening. (There are two more performances, at the Saturday matinee, which will be broadcast live on the Texaco-Metropolitan Opera Radio Network, and next Wednesday night.) In a review in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini called her portrayal riveting and said: \"Rather than reduce Salome to some perverse monster, she created an unhinged character of chilling will power, someone aghast at being thwarted by Jochanaan and coolly determined to get what she wanted -- her lips on his -- any way she could.\" Although she never completely strips in the Met production, a videotape of one of her earlier Salomes with the Deutsche Oper Berlin carries this warning: \"Contains both nudity and graphic violence. Viewer discretion advised.\"\n\nLater this year, Ms. Malfitano is to make her Los Angeles Music Center Opera debut in another signature role as Cio-Cio-San in \"Madama Butterfly,\" capping a season that began with the release of a widely hailed London recording of \"Salome,\" and star appearances in Salzburg, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and San Francisco, as well as Chicago and New York. Future bookings include Lady Macbeth in the Verdi opera and all three heroines in Puccini's \"Trittico.\" And audiences around the world remember her \"Tosca\" with Placido Domingo, filmed on location in Rome in 1992 and broadcast live to 107 countries.\n\nIt wasn't the life on stage she envisioned, she said, moving around her kitchen in a black pants suit. Growing up on the West Side, only blocks from where she lives now, she wanted to be a dancer like her mother, Maria Maslova, she said, \"but I was not built to be a dancer.\" Singing, however, came naturally from the day she climbed up on a desk in first grade to entertain her classmates. Later, she attended the High School of Music and Art and the Manhattan School of Music for voice and studied with her father, Joseph Malfitano, who was a violinist at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nShe took up as a vegan, shunning animal products, about 25 years ago as a beginning singer and devotee of yoga and transcendental meditation, she said, setting bright Deruta plates and bowls on an octagonal inlaid marble table that she and her husband designed and had built by an artisan in Florence. Under the eight sides, eight columns supported the 700-pound table top. \"I like the number 8,\" she said. \"It's the infinity sign.\"\n\nShe was singing with the New York City Opera when she met her husband-to-be, Stephen Holowid, an actor, singer and musician working with the company as an administrator. They married in 1977, and their daughter, Daphne Rose Malfitano-Holowid, was born nine years later. The three often traveled together when Ms. Malfitano, in a bold and ultimately rewarding stroke, left the United States in 1988 to experiment with a variety of nontraditional roles, and they continue to travel together whenever possible.\n\nMany artists find it hard to keep up a fitness regimen on the road, but Ms. Malfitano often makes her own lunch and carries it to rehearsals. If the air is too polluted for jogging -- in Florence, say -- she will run up the stairs to her room instead.\n\nShe adjusted the heat under the pot of chili (made with red kidney beans, peppers and onions, tofu and tempeh) and began to build a salad on a foundation of mesclun. She added sunflower seeds, bean sprouts, sliced carrots, wild rice, Jerusalem artichokes and a daikon, or Japanese radish. Then she squeezed some fresh garlic through a press and added it, along with sprinkles of mirin, the sweet Japanese wine.\n\nSalome has clearly proved a watershed role for her, she said between bites, particularly since the rapturously received Salzburg production of 1992, staged with Nazi-like symbolism by Luc Bondy and conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi leading the Vienna Philharmonic, with Bryn Terfel as Jochanaan, or John the Baptist, and recorded by London/Decca. The current Met production, which owes more to Oscar Wilde, dates from 1989.\n\nMs. Malfitano can identify with Salome. \"She grew up fast, like lots of kids today,\" she said. \"As I look at it, she never experienced love. Her father was taken away when she was a child, murdered by Herod, and her mother allowed it. She's starved for love in a divisive society of great violence.\"\n\nBy asking for the prophet's head, Salome is not seeking to punish her father, Ms. Malfitano continued. \"She's punishing Jochanaan for not giving her what she wants,\" she said. \"I play her as a beautiful, innocent creature that went down a wrong path, and then God takes her down a worse one.\"\n\nThe key to her characterization of Salome, she went on, is a detail that Strauss left out of his version of the Wilde play: before being murdered by his brother Herod, the girl's father spent 12 years in the same cistern where John the Baptist is later imprisoned. Salome had to know that and be affected by it, Ms. Malfitano reasoned. \"It's like when we read in the papers of a serial killer and eventually get to hear the background of abuse he suffered,\" she said.\n\nIn any case, Ms. Malfitano said she gets a cathartic lift out of the role. \"The more horrific the characters I play, the better I feel afterward,\" she said, recalling Salome's passionate farewell to Jochanaan: \"The mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death.\"\n\nTo round out the lunch, she set out a bowl of peeled kiwis and mugs of tangy ginger tea. \"Ginger has warming qualities,\" she said. \"It gives strength and energy.\"\n\nPhotos: In her Manhattan kitchen or as Salome at the Met, CatherineMalfitano has clear ideas -- and gets results.

        "instruction": "The following letters were written immediately previous to the assassination of President LINCOLN, and have just been brought to light:\n\nMY DEAR SIR: When all mankind are congratulating you, one voice, heard or not, is of little account; but I add mine.\n\nI am very anxious about the future; and most about the principles which are to govern reorganization; for as these principles are sound or unsound, so will be the work and its results.\n\nYou have no time to read a long letter, nor have I time to write one; so I will be brief.\n\nAnd first, as to Virginia. By the action of every branch of the government, we are committed to the recognition and maintenance of the State organization of which Gov. PEIRPOINT is the head. You know all the facts, and recapitulation would be useless. There will be a pressure for the recognition of the rebel organization, on condition of the profession of loyalty. It will be far easier and wiser, in my judgment, to stand by the loyal organization already recoganized.\n\nAnd next, as to the other rebel States.\n\nThe easiest and safest way seems to me to be the enrollment of the loyal citizens without regard to complexion, and encouragement and support of them in the reorganization of State Governments, under constitutions securing suffrage to all citizens of proper age and unconvicted for crime. This, you know, has long been my opinion. It is confirmed by observation more and more.\n\nThis way is recommended by its simplicity, facility, and, above all, justice. It will be hereafter counted equally a crime and a folly if the colored loyalists of the rebel States are left to the control of restored rebels, not likely, in that case, to be either wise or just, until taught both wisdom and justice by new calamities.\n\nThe application of the principle to Louisiana is made somewhat difficult by the organization which has already taken place; but, happily, the constitution authorizes the Legislature to extend the right of suffrage; and it is not to be doubted that, on a suggestion from the national authorities that its extension to colored citizens, on equal terms with white citizens, is believed to be essential to the future tranquility of the country, as well as just in itself, the Legislature will promptly act in the desired direction. What reaches me of the condition of things in Louisiana impresses me strongly with the belief that this extension will be of the greatest benefit to the whole population.\n\nThe same result can be secured in Arkansas by an amendment to the State Constitution, or, what would be better, I think, by a new convention, the members of which should be elected by the loyal citizens, without distinction of color. To all the other States the general principle may be easily applied.\n\nI most respectfully but most earnestly commend these matters to your attention. God gives you a great place and a great opportunity. May he guide you in the use of them.\n\nI noticed this morning your proclamation closing the ports, and was glad to see it. I presume the law of forfeiture was well considered, and also the effect of discrimination against foreign vessels. Most respectfully and truly yours, S.P. CHASE.\n\nThe next day the Chief-Justice addressed the President again on the same subject:\n\nDEAR SIR: The American of this morning contains your speech of last evening. Seeing that you say something on the subject of my letter to you yesterday -- reorganization -- and refer, though without naming me, to the suggestions I made in relation to the amnesty proclamation, when you brought it before the heads of departments, I will add some observations to what I have already written.\n\nI recollect the suggestions you mention; my impression is that they were in writing. There was another which you do not mention, and which, I think, was not in writing. It is distinct in my memory, though doubtless forgotten by you. It was an objection to the restriction of participation in reorganization to persons having the qualifications of voters under the laws in force just before the rebellion. Ever since questions of reconstruction have been talked about, it has been my opinion that colored loyalists ought to be allowed to participate in it; and it was because of this opinion that I was anxious to have the question left open. I did not, however, say much about the restriction. I was the only one who expressed a wish for its omission, and did not desire to seem pertinacious.\n\nYou will remember, doubtless, that the first order ever issued for enrollment, with a view to reorganization, went to Gen. SHEPLEY, and directed the enrollment of all loyal citizens; and I suppose that since the opinion of Attorney-General BATES, no one connected with your administration has questioned the citizenship of free colored men, more than that of free write men. The restriction in the amnesty proclamation operated as a revocation of the order to Gen. SHEPLEY; but as I understood you not to be wedded to any particular plan of reconstruction, I hoped that reflection and observation would satisfy you that the restriction should not be adhered to. I fully sympathized with your desire for the restoration of the Union by the change of rebel slave States into Union free States, and was willing, if I could not get exactly the plan I thought best, to take the plan you thought best, and trust to the future for modification.\n\nI know you attach much importance to the admission of Louisiana, or rather to her right to representation in Congress, as a loyal State in the Union. If I am not misinformed, there is nothing in the way except the indisposition of her Legislature to give proof satisfactory of loyalty by a sufficient guarantee of safety and justice to colored citizens, through the extension to loyal colored men of the right of suffrage. Why not, then, as almost every loyal man concurs with you as to the desirableness of that recognition, take the shortest road to it, by causing every proper representation to be made to the Louisiana Legislature of the importance of such extension?\n\nMr. CHASE entered more in detail into a discussion of the question, covering in the main his often expressed views, and concluded thus:\n\nOnce I should have been, if not satisfied, partially, at least, contented with suffrage for the intelligent and those who have been soldiers; now I am convinced that universal suffrage is demanded by sound policy and impartial justice. I have written too much already, and will not trouble you with my reasons. I shall return to Washington in a day or two, and perhaps it will not be disagreeable to you to have the whole subject talked over.\n\nTruly and faithfully yours, S.P. CHASE.",

He helps various people he meets, gets involved in their problems, rejoins his family and falls in love with a young woman, only to be disappointed.\n\nThat is the outline of virtually all of the Tora-san films, which Yoji Yamada has been writing and directing regularly, twice a year, since 1969. Apparently it is the style and details of the episodes more than their content that have charmed the public in Japan, which flocks to each new work.\n\nThe Japan Society at 333 East 47th Street has been presenting a series of Tora-san films on Thursdays, each preceded by a short documentary on Japan. Tonight's showing will be the penultimate in the retrospective. It is called ''Tora-san: Love Under One Umbrella,'' and the sweetheart in this case is a struggling cabaret singer named Lilly.\n\nTickets are $3.50 and go on sale at 5:30 P.M. the day of the screening.

Galvin filed a civil lawsuit against the bank, alleging it had defrauded the Massachusetts state pension fund of $29 million over a decade.\n\nOf the Massachusetts case, Hassell said, “We’re basically defending ourselves because, again, we think we provided a valuable service at a fair price.’’\n\nState Treasurer Steve Grossman, chairman of the state pension fund, has led the charge to recoup fees for the fund; he declined to comment on Hassell’s remarks, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nHassell, 59, took over as chief executive of BNY Mellon in August, after the foreign- exchange battles had already become public, following complaints filed by Madoff whistle-blower Harry Markopolos.\n\nHassell was previously president of the company; he succeeded Robert P. Kelly, who had a falling out with the board over the company’s direction.\n\nHassell said BNY Mellon was cutting costs around the world, particularly in areas related to technology. In the Boston area, where it employs about 4,000 people, the bank is in “very slow growth mode,’’ he said.\n\nDuring his speech, Hassell painted a grim portrait of the global economy and suggested that the government should “hit the pause button’’ on new financial regulations, while the industry adapts to new rules under Dodd-Frank.\n\nAsked about US Representative Barney Frank’s retirement, he said he and Frank often did not see eye to eye, but “he’s been an incredible patriot for our country.’’",

        "instruction": "The word ''tiede'' has joined ''au poivre vert'' and ''caramelise'' in the vocabularies of those who would understand a contemporary French menu. ''Tiede'' means lukewarm, and more and more dishes are being served that way. And although most of these dishes, such as poached salmon, were designed for the formal table rather than the picnic bench, many of them make ideal summer fare.\n\nNot only dishes that are normally served hot are served lukewarm, so are those that are normally served well chilled. Oysters are a good example; the Maurice restaurant in the Parker Meridien Hotel, for instance, serves ''huitres tiedes aux blancs de poireaux,'' lukewarm oysters with leeks. And salads, those crisp, cold summer favorites, are often transformed into crisp and lukewarm dishes by many nouvelle cuisine chefs.\n\nThese nouvelle chefs have given the biggest boost to lukewarm dishes. The Troisgros brothers, for example, serve a poached skate lukewarm with olive oil and coriander. But some traditional bourgeois dishes, such as potato salad, are also good served lukewarm.\n\nMany foods, particularly those that are marinated and those with an assertive dressing, simply taste better lukewarm; a refrigerator chill often kills some of the flavor. String beans, blanched and dressed with lemon, garlic and olive oil, are delicious served at room temperature. And a roast chicken can also be excellent lukewarm, especially if it is not refrigerated between cooking and serving.\n\nPaula Wolfert, author of ''The Cooking of Southwest France: Traditional and New Recipes,'' a book due out next year, says: ''Duck confit is wonderful lukewarm, especially if you serve it with burning-hot french-fried potatoes.'' She also recommends another dish from southwestern France: fresh figs roasted for an hour in a 400-degree oven and served lukewarm with caramelized walnuts, honey, pepper and cold creme fraiche.\n\nDishes that seem least suited to the ''tiede'' treatment are those with red meat, which is best either hot or cold. Michael Safdiah of the Black Sheep restaurant once served a lukewarm dish of barely cooked chicken livers and marinated shrimp, but his creation got a reception that was - well, lukewarm. ''I loved it, but people would say, 'It's not hot enough,' '' Mr. Safdiah said.\n\nThe following recipes for chicken and shrimp-and-leek salad are from Richard Burns, chef of Vanessa, a new restaurant in Greenwich Village; the recipe for brain salad is from ''Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco,'' by Paula Wolfert (Harper & Row; copyright 1973; reprinted by permission). Chicken Salad Vanessa 3/4 cup walnut oil 3 whole chicken breasts, cut in julienne strips 1/2 inch wide 1 tablespoon finely minced shallots 1 cup mushrooms, thinly sliced 3/4 cup shelled walnut pieces 1/3 cup diced canned pimento 1/3 cup Sherry vinegar Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 9 cups mixed salad greens: Boston, red leaf, romaine and watercress.\n\n1. Heat the walnut oil in a saute pan large enough to accommodate the chicken pieces in one layer. 2. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and cook quickly, browning first on one side then the other; do not allow to cook through. 3. Remove chicken from pan and add shallots, mushrooms, walnut pieces and pimento. Season with salt and pepper and saute for one minute.\n\n4. Add chicken pieces and cook for one additional minute. 5. Add vinegar and toss all ingredients together over heat. 6. Place chicken pieces over salad greens in a circular pattern. Spoon mushroom, walnut and pimento mixture over chicken. Serve lukewarm.\n\nYield: 6 servings. Shrimp and Leek Salad Vanessa 1 head Boston lettuce 3/4 cup olive oil 2 pounds medium shrimp (about 30), peeled and deveined 5 leeks, cleaned and cut into julienne strips about 3 inches long 1/3 cup Sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons minced shallots Chopped parsley.\n\n1. Arrange six plates with two leaves each of Boston lettuce. 2. Heat the oil in a 12-inch saute pan until very hot. 3. Add the shrimp and saute quickly until just pink. 4. Add the leeks, vinegar and shallots and cook one minute more until vinegar is slightly reduced. 5. Place equal portions of shrimp and leeks on each plate and pour remaining pan juices over each serving. Sprinkle the parsley over each plate. Serve lukewarm.\n\nYield: 6 servings. Brain Salad 1 pound calves', lamb or beef brains 1/4 cup freshly chopped green coriander 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley 1/2 teaspoon cumin Pinch of cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon paprika 2 to 3 cloves garlic, peeled and cut up 1/4 cup olive or salad oil 1/3 cup lemon juice 1 small tomato, peeled, seeded and cubed Salt to taste.\n\n1. Wash the brains under running water, removing the membranes and as much blood as possible. (If you feel squeamish, soak the brains in salted water to cover for one to two hours, changing the water three times.) Place the rinsed brains in the casserole with the herbs, spices, garlic and oil. Pour 1 1/2 cups water over and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, partly cover the pan and simmer 30 minutes.\n\n2. Add the lemon juice. Then, without removing the brains from the casserole, mash them into small pieces with the back of a wooden spoon. Continue simmering another 30 minutes, stirring often.\n\n3. Ten minutes before the dish is finished add the tomato. Taste for salt, and readjust the seasoning. Cool and serve lukewarm. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.",

        "instruction": "SO many options traders lose money that they have grown to suspect they are not operating on a level playing field. A recent academic study provides them with some potentially powerful ammunition.\n\nThe study, \"Stock Price Clustering on Option Expiration Dates,\" appeared last October in The Journal of Financial Economics. Its authors are Neil D. Pearson and Allen M. Poteshman, both finance professors at the University of Illinois, and Sophie Xiaoyan Ni, a Ph.D. student there. A version is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=519044.\n\nThe researchers focused on unusual trading patterns of stocks when options on them were expiring. They found an increased likelihood that a stock would close on the options expiration day at or very near the strike price of one of its expiring options.\n\nA strike price, of course, is the price at which an option's owner can buy the underlying stock (if the option is a call) or sell the stock (if the option is a put). A stock typically has options with many different strike prices, set at regular intervals — every $5, for example. Options also vary by month of expiration; all of a given month's options expire on the third Friday.\n\nIn effect, the researchers found that the closing prices of stocks that have options were not randomly distributed on expiration days, but instead tended to cluster around the strike prices of certain of their options.\n\nConsider how often a stock closes within 12.5 cents of one of its option's strike prices. On all days other than the expiration date, the researchers found, this happens about 10.5 percent of the time. But on option expiration days, this frequency jumps a full percentage point, to around 11.5 percent. That suggests that option strike prices are acting like magnets, drawing stock prices toward them.\n\nThis clustering may not seem a big deal, but the researchers say they are confident that it can't be attributed to chance. And the dollars involved are substantial. Some investors' portfolios will increase in value on the expiration day because of the clustering, while others' portfolios will suffer. The researchers estimate that for the average option expiration day from 1996 through 2002, these portfolio shifts totaled at least $9.1 billion. On an annual basis, this amounts to more than $100 billion.\n\nCould the cause of this clustering have nothing to do with options expiration? The researchers believe not, since they were unable to find a similar pattern among stocks for which no options exist. They also examined what happened to these stocks when and if options began to be traded on them. They found that clustering generally appeared almost immediately in these stocks' trading patterns on expiration days.\n\nThis clustering does not automatically mean that these stocks are being manipulated, the researchers say. It could also be caused by straightforward hedging transactions that are regularly undertaken by market makers on options exchanges. Marty Kearney, senior instructor at the Options Institute, the educational arm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said he believes that these market makers' hedges cause the bulk of any price clustering on options expiration day.\n\nThe study's authors don't disagree that market makers play a large role. But they found that the market makers' activities could not fully explain the clustering. They say it is likely that manipulation is also taking place.\n\nWho would have an incentive to manipulate stocks this way? One group would be those who sell options short, known as option writers. Traders in this group in effect are betting that the options' underlying stocks will rise (in the case of puts they have sold short) or fall (in the case of calls). They could lose big if these stocks move too far in the wrong direction.\n\nYou would need to be a very wealthy investor indeed to be able to buy or sell enough shares of a stock to move its price in a given direction. But the researchers believe that some would qualify. They focused special attention on a group known as firm proprietary traders, which includes employees of large investment banks who are trading options for those banks' accounts. The researchers argue that these traders would be in a position to manipulate stock prices by selling large numbers of shares whose prices they wanted to keep from rising and by buying other shares whose prices they wanted to support.\n\nThe researchers say that it is impossible to identify any particular firm that may have engaged in manipulation because they had access only to aggregate data for firm proprietary traders as a whole.\n\nEven if they did have data for individual firms, it would still be hard to prove that any one of them specifically engaged in deliberate stock manipulation, which would be illegal. Such proof would depend on demonstrating what the firm's traders were intending to do when buying or selling stocks on expiration day. And there is no shortage of plausible explanations that those traders could provide for their behavior.\n\nIn an interview, Lawrence E. Harris, a former chief economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a finance professor at the University of Southern California, says the difficulty in proving manipulation is probably an inherent feature of modern markets. \"Because the markets are so complex,\" he said, \"it is relatively easy for traders engaged in manipulation to offer alternative explanations for their behavior that would make it difficult to successfully prosecute them.\"\n\nProfessor Harris nonetheless said that \"when presented with the data suggesting manipulation by firm proprietary traders, it's reasonable to expect that the S.E.C. would consider investigating the matter further.\" The S.E.C. had no comment on the researchers' study.\n\nAt least two major lessons can be drawn from the study, according to Professor Harris. First, he said, \"there are limits to what the S.E.C. can do to protect you from the actions of clever traders who arrange their trades to put you at a disadvantage.\" The second, he said, is this: \"Unsophisticated traders should be wary of trading options.\"\n\nMark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch.

        "instruction": "IT started earlier this summer with a little red spot on the boy's cheek. No one thought anything of it - until weeks after he had left Fire Island for camp in New England. Then, suddenly, the 11-year-old fell ill with flu-like symptoms and had to be hospitalized for arthritic pains.\n\nLyme disease had struck again. Named for the Connecticut shoreline community where it came to attention in 1975, the nonfatal skin, muscle and joint disease, which is believed to be spread by ticks, has since turned up on Long Island, elsewhere along the East Coast and in other spots across the nation. This summer's cases on Fire Island have been linked to ticks carried by a herd of deer on the island's Federal preserve, but the bloodsucking parasites are also said to be carried by mice and perhaps household pets.\n\nSince the disease was detected, a team of doctors at Yale has examined some 600 patients, most of them from the area between East Haddam and Old Lyme, east of the Connecticut River, but some also from Scarsdale, Briarcliff, and Tarrytown in Westchester, and Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket in Massachusetts.\n\nAbout 100 cases were detected this summer, mostly in Connecticut, and for the first time, a scientist from the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta joined the research at Yale in June.\n\nFederal scientists and health authorities say that Lyme disease and, in its later stage, Lyme arthritis, are not matters f or alarm and are not reportable diseases, which means physicians ar e not required to report cases to the Government. But Fire Islan ders and others who have encountered a dozen or so cases this summe r say greater awareness of the disease is necessary if problems are to be avoided.\n\nAs in the case of the now-recovering 11-year-old boy from Point O' Woods, Fire Island - where 10 cases have come to attention so far this season -the disease first manifests itself as a skin rash, radiating outward from the red mark of a tick bite. Because the rash spreads, it has been named ''erythema chronium migrans'' - literally, redness-chronic-moving. It is also sometimes accompanied by chills, fever, a stiff neck and nausea.\n\nThose symptoms and the rash may disappear within a few days, but a week to several months later the muscle and joint pain and stiffness of arthritis can appear. There can also be attacks of meningitis, nerve paralysis and heart irregularity. But in 90 percent of the cases, according to Dr. Charles Herron, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the ailment subsides and leaves no permanent aftereffect. In the other 10 percent, he said, there can be chronic arthritis, but he said he was not aware of any fatalities. The disease is not viewed as contagious. Penicillin has been found to be effective in some cases.\n\nLyme disease was first described in 1976 by three scientists at the rheumatology section of Yale's Department of Medicine, Dr. Allen Steere, Dr. Stephen Malawista and Dr. John Hardin, who had begun seeing the cases the previous year. Because its symptoms were often mistaken for those of other ailments, earlier outbreaks went essentially undetected, although occurrences had been noted in Wisconsin, Scandinavia and West Germany, and after Lyme, in California, Oregon, New Jersey and, lately, perhaps in Georgia.\n\nDr. Steere was able to track down about 510 cases through 1979 and another 226 in 1980. This year will probably see an equal or greater number, Dr. Herron estimated, bringing the total known cases to date in this country to about 1,000. The tick that has been implicated in the East, according to Dr. Herron, is named Ixodes dammini, a parasite of the eight-legged spider family.\n\nDr. Donald Cameron, an internal medicine practitioner at New York Hospital and the chairman of the medical committee in Point O' Woods, said that a mapping of the 10 cases in his community placed them all in a thickly foliated area favored by the semi-tame deer at Sunken Forest, the adjacent Federal preserve. The deer wander fearlessly into the community in the early morning, he said.\n\nPeople who have visited Fire Island, Dr. Cameron added, should watch for symptoms of Lyme disease and report them to a physician. Early treatment with penicillin has been effective in some cases in pre-empting the onset of the arthritis stage, he said.\n\n''There's no real way to get away from the ticks, so people have to be aware of the problem,'' said Robert Feeney, a businessman-chemist and Fire Islander whose daughter and wife came down with the disease, the daughter 10 years ago, the wife last summer. Both made full recoveries.\n\nSun worshippers are particularly vulnerable but campers and hikers can protect themslves to some extent with long sleeves, tight cuffs and insect repellent.\n\n''It's a new entity, so nobody really knows the extent of it,'' said Dr. Mahfouz Zaki, Director of Public Health for Suffolk County, L.I. . ''But I bet you, once it's established, you'll be seeing cases all over.''",

        "instruction": "BERKEY PHOTO INC. drew major support on Wall Street a couple of years ago when the Federal District Court in Manhattan awarded the company $87 million in its antitrust action against the Eastman Kodak Company. Berkey had accused Kodak of trying to monopolize film processing and other aspects of the photography business.\n\nSoon, however, the victory was severely modified. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the judgment to the extent of $45.8 million, although the appeals court did decide a separate point in Berkey's favor. The upshot is that Berkey will be able to recover no more than $60 million on retrial, even if every point is decided in its favor.\n\nBerkey shares, which reached 9 5/8 before the appellate ruling, dropped substantially thereafter and began to seesaw in the months that followed.\n\nBerkey's effort to get the Supreme Court to review the decision ended in failure. The shares then dropped to 3 in early 1980. They traded between 3 and 7 in both 1979 and 1980, and these wide swings account for the speculative appeal of the shares. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Berkey closed yesterday at 3 7/8, up 1/8.\n\nThe case is now back at the district court level, and the parties have been meeting with Judge Vincent Broderick to decide whether to pursue the case in court or to settle it. Elizabeth Clancy, senior counsel to Berkey, reached by telephone yesterday, said that a decision on how to proceed was not imminent.\n\nBerkey's earnings pattern has been erratic in recent years, a result of wide swings in the price of silver and photographic paper. The company is an independent film processor and a distributor of cameras and photographic equipment. It also operates the Willoughby's retail outlets. Berkey reported earnings of just 8 cents a share for 1980 after a fourth-quarter loss of $1.3 million on the discontinuance of its graphic arts business. The company had earned 65 cents a share in 1979. Analysts expect Berkey to earn 60 cents a share in 1981.\n\nNevertheless, the company has speculative appeal at current prices because the shares are selling at less than intrinsic value, says Sam Skurnick, a broker with Bruns Nordeman Rae who also owns a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nMr. Skurnick says the book value is about $4.50 a share. ''I feel Berkey is a good, low-priced speculation,'' he commented. A second broker, who owns the shares and who looks at underlying values, says they are worth even more than the book value suggests. He argued that it would cost about $15 a share to replace the company's film-processing facilities.\n\nAdding to the company's appeal, according to the second broker, is the fact that Berkey is the second-largest film processor (after Kodak) with some 10,000 dealers. Furthermore, about 20 percent of the stock is owned by two shareholders - Ben Berkey, the company's chairman, with 13 percent and the Transamerica Corporation with 7 percent - thus limiting the trading supply. There are 5 million Berkey shares outstanding.\n\nOne analyst - who works at a firm that does not permit its people to be quoted on companies with shares trading below $5 - suggests that Berkey is a potential takeover candidate, particularly since it has a $19 million tax-loss carry-forward.\n\nHe says that a large corporation in a consumer products field - a food company that could offer Berkey processing in supermarkets, for example -might become interested. But he condedes that he knows of no takeover interest in Berkey at this time.\n\nStill another broker offered an explanation for the periodic flurries in Berkey shares. He said that a low-priced stock with relatively few shares outstanding was like a gambling chip. People like to play with such low-priced shares because the ''floor'' under any Big Board-listed company is about $2 a share. Thus there is little risk for the speculator on the low end of the price scale. The broker added:\n\n''I don't mind buying such a stock on the way down. I think the shares are good for a $5 number in the next year, and that's a 60 percent appreciation.''\n\nThe broker regards such a low-priced stock as a ''perpetual warrant'' - a low-cost option to buy into an enterprise that may become exciting in time.\n\nIn spite of all this upbeat comment, Berkey shares seem to lack wide appeal on a fundamental basis. That was clear at the last annual meeting, held in White Plains - 15 of the 6,900 shareholders attended.",

        "instruction": "Admit it: You’ve thought about buying an electric car. If but for a fleeting moment, you considered the possibilities: Zero tailpipe emissions. No more oil changes, no more tune-ups. Cheap fuel. And it seems pretty cool.\n\nThen, if you’re like most people, you set the idea aside.\n\nThat disconnect is apparent in the U.S., where all-electric vehicles account for less than 1% of new car sales. With gasoline prices low and stable, historically gas-guzzling pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and crossovers are what Americans want to buy.\n\nLive updates from the 2016 L.A. Auto Show 2016 »\n\nYet at the Los Angeles Auto Show, which opens to the public Friday, Porsche, Mitsubishi, Jaguar and Mini will unveil their new all-electric models or electric concept cars.\n\nCadillac will show off its CT6 plug-in, while Chevy will be pumping the Bolt, an all-electric sedan with a 238-mile range that starts shipping to dealers within weeks.\n\nAnd electric car leader Tesla — a first-time auto show attendee — will hold a party outdoors, where its all-electric Model X will be hooked to an Airstream trailer to conjure the long-distance travel possibilities provided by Tesla’s Supercharger battery network.\n\nSo, on one hand, the market share for electric cars is minuscule. On the other, big automakers are aggressively pushing their electric cars. What gives?\n\n“There’s the market of what the market wants, and there’s the market of what the federal government wants,” said auto industry veteran Bob Lutz, who championed the creation of the Chevy Volt extended-range hybrid while vice chairman at General Motors. “And the two markets are miles apart.”\n\nIt’s up to the automakers to pull them together. They’ll have to. Stricter government mandates on fuel economy are fast approaching. Federal regulations call for average fuel consumption for each maker’s fleets to hit 42 miles per gallon in 2020 and 54.2 by 2025.\n\nTo meet them, “Everybody is going to have to do major electrification,” Lutz said. Even if they lose money doing it.\n\nIt’s unclear what effect President-elect Donald Trump will have on environmental regulations. Lutz predicts big automakers would resist major changes on efficiency standards at this point because of the capital investments already made in meeting them. The regulations are a bit flexible depending on market demand, however, and could get looser still.\n\nAt his news conference Monday, President Obama said automakers “have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set.” He also praised California for its “clean energy agenda.”\n\nStill, the high cost of batteries means it still costs more to build an electric car than one with a traditional combustion engine. That’s a big reason the electric car market share is so low: Few consumers are willing to pay a premium, even when $7,500 in federal subsidies and other state incentives are taken into account.\n\nTo meet the mandates, carmakers calibrate how many electrics and plug-in hybrids they must sell, and set prices accordingly. A trickle of e-cars is becoming a stream as the deadline draws near.\n\nThe growing availability of electric vehicles piqued the interest of Michael Webb, a lighting architect who lives in Berkeley. Still, after test-driving a number of EVs, he hasn’t found anything that has persuaded him to ditch his boxy Toyota Scion xB.\n\n“Electric cars are the cars of the future,” he said. He likes Tesla, but it’s out of his price range; the other choices currently on the market “are not acceptable in size or range.”\n\nFor carmakers hoping to profit from electric cars, there are signs of hope.\n\nBattery costs are plummeting, even as power and range increase. Batteries are the most expensive part of an electric car, accounting typically for about a third of the cost.\n\nThose costs, though, have dropped 65% over the last five years and are still headed down, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Partly that’s due to greater volume and scale, but advances are being made in battery chemistry too.\n\nMore efficiency means more power, and, most important, more range. Until recently, most electric cars could travel barely more than 100 miles on a single charge. New models such as the Chevy Bolt and the upcoming Tesla Model 3 will travel 200 miles or more between charges.\n\nThat hundred more miles could make a big difference in reducing so-called range anxiety. A survey of 837 Californians conducted in August by Vrge Analytics found that 43% would consider buying or leasing an electric vehicle by 2025. If those vehicles were priced similar to combustion-engine cars and offered a range of 200 or more miles per charge, the number jumped to nearly two-thirds.\n\n“It’s the 200-miles border which makes electric vehicles acceptable to the majority of car buyers,” said Roland Irle, co-founder of consulting firm EV Volumes, based in Sweden.\n\nAccording to forecasts from Ark Invest, a Camry-quality 200-mile range electric car will cost less than a gasoline Camry by 2022.\n\nBefore Tesla, automobile executives complained that they were being forced to manufacture cars that people didn’t want to buy. Dealers, too, were reluctant to sell them because electric cars require less maintenance.\n\nBut the Tesla Model S is now the world’s bestselling luxury car model, beating out models from Mercedes, BMW, Audi and others and their gas and diesel powertrains. At least 373,000 customers have put down $1,000 deposits on the Model 3.\n\n“I wouldn’t underestimate the influence Tesla has had on pushing the other manufacturers along,” said Colin McKerracher, head of advanced transportation research for Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\nNor would he underestimate China. Now the world’s largest motor vehicle market, China is also the world’s largest and fastest growing market for electric cars. Government incentives and mandates have created thriving demand as the country’s leaders seek to clear the notoriously foul air that hovers over its major cities.\n\nAbout 134,000 all electric and plug-in hybrid cars were sold in China in the first half of this year, more than twice as many as in the U.S., and at a far faster growth rate.\n\nAutomakers from Europe, Japan, the U.S. and Korea want in to the China market, and also need to be prepared if China manages to export cheap electric cars of sufficient quality.\n\nIn the meantime, there’s talk in some countries of banning combustion engines in new cars altogether, which would give new-fuel vehicles a huge boost.\n\nIndia, which made news recently as the citizens of Delhi choked on polluted air, is talking about banning new combustion-driven cars within a decade.\n\nSo are Norway, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, motivated by concerns over global warming, according to Irle. “Nobody has done it yet, but the proposals are being taken seriously,” he said.\n\nThe emissions cheating scandal not only will cost the company billions as it deals with a criminal investigation, it also blew up plans at VW and other German automakers to rely heavily on supposedly cleaner diesel engines to help meet clean-air and fuel-efficiency requirements.\n\nAs the diesel drama continues, Volkswagen is suddenly a great champion of electrified cars, pledging that a quarter of its sales will consist of electrics and plug-in hybrids by 2025.\n\n“That’s the world’s biggest carmaker, and 2025 is not very far away for the auto industry,” McKerracher said.\n\nFisker will challenge Tesla with its own high-end electric car\n\nTesla will start charging money to use its supercharging stations\n\nTesla adds hard-core German engineering to its 'Alien Dreadnought'\n\n4:40 p.m.: This article was updated with comments from President Obama’s news conference.\n\nThis article was originally published at 8 a.m.",

        "instruction": "With summer finally in full swing, parents are starting to relax as they unwind from all the responsibilities of the school year. No more pencils, no more books, no more . . . reminding your kids to take their pencils and books.\n\nIt’s understandable that with the warm weather parents will want some time off, too.\n\nBut one thing that parents should remain vigilant about through the summer is bullying — which is at least as much of a problem in the summer, with lax parental oversight and fewer authority figures monitoring kids’ behavior now that they’re not in school.\n\nMy overall parenting style can be described as mostly shrugging my shoulders and saying, “They’re alive, right?” Yet bullying is one thing I believe should be taken very seriously. In addition to all the horror stories about bullied kids killing themselves or others, bullying can have lasting effects on a child that will be carried into adulthood.\n\nBut most anti-bullying guides are written by people who clearly don’t remember what it’s like to be a kid — and can’t imagine what it’s like being one in a world where there’s a hot new social-media app every few months.\n\nStopbullying.gov, an anti-bullying site managed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, for example, gives advice like “Look at the kid bullying you and tell him or her to stop in a calm, clear voice” or “Create posters for your school about bullying.”\n\nThese after-school special strategies just don’t work in the real world. Here are three that do:\n\n1. Don’t put all of your kid’s friendship eggs in one basket. It’s common for kids to make the majority of their friends at school and, in the summer, at camp. But if that’s 100 percent of their friendships, they risk relying too heavily on a particular group.\n\nKids are flighty. Even setting aside actual bullying, a kid can decide tomorrow not to be your child’s friend. If you encourage your son or daughter to have a varied network of friends — from their block, from a sport they play outside of school, from the park, the children of your friends, pen pals, etc. — they’ll be less likely to maintain a friendship with someone who isn’t treating them as well as they should and less likely to be crushed if someone drops them.\n\n2. I teach my kids to be good people. My daughter will automatically go over to a kid sitting on their own at a party or park. But it’s important that niceness doesn’t lead to being a pushover.\n\nNot responding to bullies, or merely asking the bully to stop in a calm, clear voice, is no solution. I teach my kids verbal comebacks for bullying situations. Recently my daughter told me two boys had tried to trick her. I taught her to say “Good one!” and then deadpan “not really.” She’s 6 so that sort of thing is devastating and perplexing to her aggravators. They haven’t bothered her since.\n\nMark Dombeck, a psychologist and former Director of Mental Help Net, quotes a 2004 Spanish college study that “suggests that there is a direct relationship between victim’s perception of control over their bullying experience and the extent of long-term difficulties they experience as a result of bullying. This is to say that bullied students who believed they were able to influence and/or escape their bullies reported fewer negative long -term effects from having been bullied than did students who felt helpless to influence their situation while it was happening.”\n\nAs a kid, I was a chubby redhead who didn’t speak English — an immigrant from the Soviet Union during the Cold War ’80s. Things could’ve gone very badly for me. But I stood up for myself at every opportunity and that feeling of control let me brush off anyone being mean to me.\n\n3. Step in. It seems like the worst thing a parent can be called these days is a “helicopter parent,” but stepping in when your child is being harassed isn’t helicoptering. You shouldn’t still be arranging playdates for them when they’re pre-teens or getting into the minutiae of their friendships, but letting your kids know you always have their back is an important way to fight bullying.\n\nA poster at school isn’t going to help. A parent reaching out to the bully’s parent will.\n\nBullies thrive in situations of limited supervision so summer is a ripe time for them. Don’t be afraid to hover if your kid seems to be avoiding camp or has mood changes. Fighting bullying requires giving your kids the tools to do that fighting. A parent’s role is to keep providing those tools.",

        "instruction": "'Giving a camera to Diane Arbus is like giving a hand grenade to a baby,'' Norman Mailer said after seeing how she had captured him, leaning back in a velvet armchair with his legs splayed cockily. The quip was funny, but a little off base. A camera for Arbus was like a latchkey. With one around her neck, she could open almost any door. Fearless, tenacious, vulnerable -- the combination conquered resistance. In an eye-opening sequence in ''Revelations,'' the compendious new book that is being published in tandem with a full-scale retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, you discover with a start the behind-the-scenes drama that produced her famous photograph of ''A Naked Man Being a Woman.'' As her title indicates, it is a portrait of a young man standing naked in his apartment, genitals tucked out of sight, in a Venus-on-the-half-shell pose. First she photographed him as a bouffant-haired young matron on a park bench; then at home in a bra and half slip; unwigged and unclothed a few moments later, with legs demurely crossed; up posing for the prized shot; and finally, as a seemingly ordinary fellow back on a park bench. Somehow, she had persuaded him to take her home and expose a secret life. It's what she did again and again. ''She got herself to go up to people on the street and ask if she could photograph them,'' recalls her former husband, Allan Arbus. ''One thing she often said was, 'I'm just practicing.''' He chuckles. ''And indeed, I guess she was.''\n\nDuring her lifetime, Arbus was lionized, but she was also lambasted for being exploitative. Her suicide in 1971 seemed to corroborate the caricature of her as a freaky ghoul. The critic Susan Sontag divined that Arbus photographed ''people who are pathetic, pitiable, as well as repulsive,'' from a vantage point ''based on distance, on privilege, on a feeling that what the viewer is asked to look at is really other.'' Patricia Bosworth's biography in 1984 took the suicide as an emblem of the life and told a lurid tale that is neatly summarized by the tag line on the paperback edition: ''HER CAMERA WAS THE WINDOW TO A TORTURED SOUL.'' In The New York Review of Books, Jonathan Lieberson eviscerated Bosworth's book but also deprecated Arbus's pictures as ''mannered, static snapshots'' that were ''chaste, icy, stylized.'' Chaste, icy, stylized? Arbus's friend Richard Avedon, maybe. Not Diane Arbus.\n\nDoon Arbus was 26 when Diane died. As the older daughter of a divorced mother, she took on the responsibility of managing the estate. Her response to the critics was to clamp the spigot shut. Arbus's letters, journals and diaries could not be examined. Anyone wishing to reproduce Arbus photographs would have to submit the book or article for Doon's vetting; any museum contemplating a retrospective had to enlist her active collaboration. In almost all cases, permission was denied. Unsurprisingly, critics and scholars fumed. As Anthony W. Lee, the co-author of a new academic treatise, ''Diane Arbus: Family Albums,'' puts it in an acid footnote, ''Those familiar with the writings on Arbus's photographs will recognize a common thread that joins them all, which this essay also shares: nearly all are published without the benefit of reproductions of some of her most famous work.'' That work now appeared in three handsome, meticulous monographs, which over the last three decades Doon has compiled and released.\n\nSo it comes as a shock to see -- in the first full-scale museum retrospective since 1972 and in the book -- that Diane Arbus at long last is presented whole. Together with the pictures that have become icons (the Jewish giant and his bewildered parents, the disturbingly different identical twins, the in-process transvestite in hair curlers, etc.), there are many of her photographs that have never been seen (or even, in some cases, printed). Better still, there is a rich assortment of extracts from her letters and journals that reveal her to be a quirky, funny, first-rate writer, an extraordinarily loving mother and an empathetic observer of her photographic subjects. More than 30 years after her death, a new portrait is emerging of one of the most powerful American artists of the 20th century, in the style that she favored. Uncropped.\n\nAllan, who is now a trim and graceful white-haired man of 85, gave Diane her first camera soon after they married in 1941. She was 18, and they had met five years earlier, when he started working at Russek's department store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the fur and clothing emporium founded by her grandfather and run by her father, David Nemerov. Diane was the second of three children (her older brother, Howard, became a prize-winning poet). She was named for a character in a play her mother enjoyed; as with her fictional namesake, it was pronounced ''Dee-ann.'' During Diane's childhood, the Nemerovs lived in large apartments on Central Park West and on Park Avenue. ''The family fortune always seemed to me humiliating,'' she told the journalist Studs Terkel. ''It was like being a princess in some loathsome movie'' set in ''some kind of Transylvanian obscure Middle European country.'' The public rooms were filled with reproduction French furniture in slipcovers. In the Nemerovs' home life, as in their ritzy clothing store, everything was for show.",

        "instruction": "KLAMATH FALLS, Ore.— Here's Al Ullman - 12 terms in the United States House of Representatives, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, and campaigning for Congress like some aspiring challenger.\n\nAttending Nazaire and Norma Smith's backyard coffee. Visiting the local Weyerhaeuser Company plant at 6:30 in the morning. Holding a news conference in the county courthouse annex for four local reporters. Dropping in on the center for the elderly out by the fairgrounds.\n\nThe 56-year-old Democrat got just 55 percent of the vote in a May primary against an little-known candidate and holds only a sixpercentage-point lead in polls on the November race. A Problem of Losing Touch\n\nHis problem is partly a difficulty familiar to the long-time legislator: losing touch with his district. Mr. Ullman doesn't even have a home in Oregon anymore. And he has gotten himself in trouble by calling for a Value Added Tax, a kind of national sales tax, which he proposed last year but has now backed away from.\n\nThe Congressman is acutely aware of his problem. ''We're going to have to do more than we've ever done before,'' he told a new volunteer, Harriet Andresen, at a recent get-together. He has been spending almost every spare moment in his district, including this week, the week of the Democratic National Convention.\n\n''We made our point and he's responding,'' said Fred Herd, a State Senator from Klamath Falls. ''I think he's coming along and putting it together.''\n\nBut Mr. Ullman still faces a determined opponent, Dennis A. Smith, a 43-year old former airline pilot and son of a former governor who also owns a dozen newspapers in the area. And Lloyd Marbet, an antinuclear activist, may join the race as an independent, threatening to draw votes mostly from Mr. Ullman. Time and Money Invested\n\nThe Marbet effort faces considerable financial problems, but Mr. Smith will spend as much as $300,000, four times what any Ullman challenger has ever spent. And he has been campaigning for a full year, never failing to remind voters of Mr. Ullman's sponsorship of VAT and of the sad state of the economy.\n\n''Here was a man pretty well out of touch with his district,'' Mr. Smith said of the Congressman. ''The important thing about the VAT is that his vision is that we need more taxes, not that we need less taxation.''\n\nFor his part, Mr. Ullman has disowned his sponsorship of the national sales tax. ''I want to make it very clear that it is not on the agenda; it is dead,'' Mr. Ullman said at a town meeting at the Ponderosa Junior High School. ''It is a dead issue,'' Mr. Ullman repeats over and over as speakers from the audience of about 50 people continue to raise the matter.\n\nWith a conservative Democratic district - ''most Democrats around here make Eastern Republicans look liberal,'' one local politician said - Mr. Ullman trumpets his conservatism, from staunch opposition to gun control to his leadership in killing the 10-cent gasoline fee proposed by President Carter. Help With Problems\n\nLike almost any incumbent, Mr. Ullman has done his best to bring the power of his office to bear, saying to one questioner who has had a problem getting Social Security benefits, ''I invite you to be in touch with my office or with me personally.''\n\n''Just having a meeting makes them feel better,'' Mr. Ullman says after the two-hour session ends. ''For every person here, there are a thousand who know I'm in town.''\n\nHe also has been offering more help on general concerns. As he traverses his district, he takes care to be able to announce Federal help for local problems as often as possible. In Klamath Falls, the announcement is of special exceptions from the limitation of 160 acres on farms qualifying for Federal irrigation water.\n\n''Some freshman Congressmen might be the smartest guys in the world but nobody would listen to them,'' said C.T. (Tag) Howland, a rancher from Bonanza, about 40 miles away, who considers the water exemptions of prime importance. A Low-Key Campaign\n\nThe Ullman campaign style is distinctively low-key, particularly in contrast to Mr. Ullman's fast, high-profile pace in Washington. In Oregon's second Congressional district, which covers 73 percent of the state's land area, the population density is sparse and the air service poor, so the Congressman drives from town to town in a Buick LaSalle, accompanied by only one aide.\n\nSpeeches are few or nonexistent; more typical are the backyard coffees like the one the Smiths threw in their modern ranch house here. Wearing a casual tweed jacket and no tie, the normally taciturn Mr. Ullman smiled frequently as he moved easily through the crowd, putting Washington style aside among constituents whose average income is just $8,821.",

        "instruction": "ÂDawsonÂs Creek,Â the weekly drama series thatÂs as hormonally driven as its teenage audience, upped its already high sexual content last night when one of its 17-year-old characters realized he was gay.\n\nAfter struggling with his sexual identity, ÂDawsonÂsÂ Â Jack McPhee came out Â a week after confidently vowing to girlfriend Joey Potter, played by the current crown princess of teen stars, Katie Holmes Â that he wasnÂt gay.\n\nThe move marks the first time the actual process of coming out has been portrayed on a TV show specifically aimed at a young audience. It raises plenty of questions for the show, parents and kids.\n\nTrue, gay revelations arenÂt new to the tube. Nearly two years ago, Ellen DegeneresÂ sitcom character came out (as did the actress) to the fanfare of a major media blitz.\n\nBut this time out, nearly 6 million viewers, most of them not legal adults, are watching JackÂs drama unfold. The showÂs creator, Kevin Williamson, promises JackÂs struggles with his sexuality will continue Â a revelation thatÂs causing obvious reaction from groups like the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and the ParentsÂ Television Council.\n\nWilliamson, who scripted the box-office blockbusters ÂScreamÂ and ÂI Know What You Did Last Summer,Â has emerged as an auteur for teens, this generationÂs John Hughes (ÂThe Breakfast Club,Â ÂSixteen CandlesÂ). He had planned from the first for ÂCreekÂ to have a gay character, since, as he says, the show is heavily autobiographical.\n\nÂIÂm a workaholic, so I never did ÂThe AdvocateÂ cover route because I wanted to speak through my work,Â explains Williamson, who says if he hasnÂt publicly discussed being gay before it came up in this context, it was because no one ever asked.\n\nÂI donÂt see where I serve myself, or anyone else, to scream at the top of my lungs that IÂm gay.Â\n\nWilliamson, 33, grew up in a small town (in North Carolina) just like the showÂs characters Â ÂDawsonÂ follows a group of preternaturally sophisticated high schoolers who live in tiny, fictional Capeside, Mass. So while his story is similar to McPheeÂs, it isnÂt the same.\n\nÂI was welcomed with open arms by my parents,Â he recalls. Yet McPhee, even as he faces his fatherÂs rejection, represents Williamson's fantasy fulfilled. \"He handles it all in a way that was much more intelligent than mine. He has a level of insight that I didn't particularly have at that age.\"\n\nWilliamson also promises to tackle stereotypes in upcoming \"Dawson\" episodes. For instance, he says, the McPhee character may quarterback the high school football team.\n\nIt's now easy to see why there are suddenly a lot of adults watching Jack's drama unfold on The WB's top teenage show.\n\n\"We love it,\" says Scott Seomin, the media director of GLAAD. \"It's important for a couple of reasons. This is an age when people can be so confused about who they are sexually and, while we're seeing more gay images on television, we're not seeing people struggle with it.\n\n\"Watching this, a young viewer can see that the student sitting next to him in study hall could be gay. Or that he himself might be gay. It's important for both gay kids and the straight kids to understand that gay students exist and it's okay to support them.\"\n\nToo much sex, too soon\n\nWhile Dorothy Swanson, president of the advocacy group Viewers for Quality Television, praises \"Dawson\" for \"including this issue as a part of teenage life,\" she says some members object to the show's focus on sex, particularly its debut episode last spring, in which a 15-year-old started an affair with his English teacher. (Indeed, a criticism often leveled at \"Dawson\" since its debut is that its characters are too old to be that young too savvy, too self-possessed, too experienced.)\n\nAnd while the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who last week accused a Teletubby of promoting effeminacy to toddlers, wouldn't make himself available to comment, the chairman of the conservative Parent's Television Council, Brent Bozell 3rd, finds it \"wholly distasteful.\n\n\"When you know that your audience is young, you have to know presenting them with such difficult questions is wrong,\" says Bozell. \"But there is very much an agenda in Hollywood to advance the cause of homosexuality as normal behavior by making those who think otherwise the deviants. A character can put forward an argument, but you can be sure it's a character who moonlights as a troglodyte.\"\n\nIf not a troglodyte, then how about a fundamendalist Christian in the form of high school hunk Tyson? He's currently courting Creeker Jen (Michelle Williams) by showing the town's bad girl a good time in one of the bars he frequents. He's the only one of the featured characters to get really righteous about McPhee's homosexuality, and he's immediately chastised by Jen's devout grandmother.

DeGeneres' famous coming out, of course, infamously degenerated, and while less prominent characters on \"ER\" and \"Chicago Hope\" have declared their homosexuality, neither show has exactly mined the disclosures for developments.\n\nBut Paul Stupin, the producer of \"Dawson's Creek,\" says he sees many, many possibilities in McPhee's stunning sexual about-face to \"complicate the relationships . . . and keep the show's sense of unpredictability at the forefront.\n\n\"This is a journey we will definitely be following,\" he asserts.\n\nThis new \"Dawson\" development is also expected to create a path for other teen shows, such as \"Popular,\" a series in development now at The WB in which teen characters explore same-sex sexuality.\n\n\"It's something we're definitely going to want to look at,\" says Ryan Murphy, the creator of \"Popular,\" which is best described as an identity dramedy for the locker crowd.\n\n\"If you can do this topic and do it well, you might be able to save one person any amount of pain.

They are harassed on a daily basis and can end up engaging in or getting lost in risk behaviors.\n\n\"We also know gay teenagers think what is happening now on the show is of tremendous value.\"\n\nBut Williamson isn't done rocking the boat yet. Not many viewers will be prepared to see McPhee step back into the closet.\n\nWilliamson says McPhee's going to be in and then out again before we know it. He gets gleeful reeling off a rapid-fire list of things that could come, though the chronicle is of a maybe, and then maybe not, nature. What is definite, he adds, is that at some point next season McPhee will date.\n\n\"But if anyone thinks that because we've opened up the door it's now everyone into gayland, then they couldn't be more wrong,\" he warns. \"As we follow one character's perspective into another, we wind up back at the heart of the show. Which is Joey and Dawson, arm in arm.\"\n\nWho knows, though? If the character intrigues enough viewers to invite a spinoff, McPhee could one find himself up a creek all his own.\n\nTHE HOUSE THAT BUILT JACK AND HOW HE GREW\n\nCharacter: Jack McPhee, 17-year-old junior at Capeside High.\n\nPrior Most Traumatic Event: His 20-year-old brother, Tim, died in a car accident a year ago.\n\nMother: Betsy, suffers from hallucinations.\n\nFather: Will, suffers from being an SOB (ran out after Tim's death).\n\nSister: Annie, 16, a sophomore, suffers from depression.\n\nOct. 14, 1998: Arrives in Capeside and takes a job at The Ice House restaurant where Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) works.

        "instruction": "PAONIA, Colo., April 10— The long valley of the north fork of the Gunnison River here, where the steeply pitched foothills block the view of distant, snow-capped Rockies, could almost be mistaken for a coal mine hollow in West Virginia.\n\nThe coal company tipples, machines that empty coal from a mine car by tipping, huddle beside the road. They are fed by conveyors that angle out from the slopes through which Route 133 twists. The road is full of potholes, caused by the heavy coal trucks, and the roadside is littered with trash. Railroad tracks run parallel to the road, and throbbing teams of diesel locomotives frequently roll by, hauling out 100-car loads of coal.\n\nThe scene could be in Logan County, W.Va, along the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River. But the differences between western Colorado and West Virginia are far greater than the similarities of the coal fields. Vote of Approval in West\n\nTwo weeks ago union coal miners from western Pennsylvania to Alabama, along the ridge line of the Appalachian coal fields, started what may be another long coal strike by overwhelmingly rejecting the contract settlement that had been negotiated by Sam M. Church Jr., president of the United Mine Workers of America. At the same time, miners in Colorado were approving the proposed agreement by 77 percent.\n\nToday the miners here are both puzzled and angered by their ''strike-happy'' brothers and sisters in the East. But most miners in Colorado are supporting the national contract strike that they personally did not want and that they perceive as injurious to them and to the long-term interests of the nation's oldest industrial union.\n\nUnion organizing drives in the West, designed to win union representation rights at the majority of coal mines that remain nonunion, have repeatedly foundered because of the nonunion miners' perception of their Eastern peers as ''a bunch of crazies,'' as one card-carrying miner here put it.\n\nJoe Vorhees, the 30-year-old president of Local Union 6417 in Paonia, called the current strike ''a real setback to organizing anyone.''\n\n''Why would anyone who wants steady work want to join an outfit like this?'' he asked. Some Miners Are Working\n\nWhat disturbs miners almost as much as being involuntarily idle is that hundreds of other union members are working, strike or no strike, at mines whose new contracts are identical with the settlement that was rejected.\n\nThey are working, and ''feeling like scabs'' as one of them put it, because their employers, although unionized by the United Mine Workers, are technically outside the so-called ''national coal agreement.''\n\nThe companies that are still working in Colorado - Western Slope Carbon, the Bear Mine and Colorado Fuel and Iron - are not members of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the Washington-based negotiating arm of the major Eastern and Middle Western producers.\n\nAs a result, when union members here overwhelmingly approved Mr. Church's settlement terms, the three Colorado companies were free to sign independently, company by company, the same contract that was rejected and that spurred the so-called national coal strike at the end of March.\n\nThe psychological dissonance that has resulted is leading rank and file miners in Colorado to criticize not only miners in the East but also the coal operators' association.\n\n''Out here we don't hate the industry the way they do in Appalachia,'' said Frank Kanerly, the 64-year-old former president of the local here. He and Mr. Vorhees were having a midmorning beer at The Portal saloon and gas station across the road from United States Steel's Somerset Mine, which is being struck. Mr. Vorhees is ordinarily a mine mechanic at Somerset.\n\n''I've had 20 phone calls from my guys wanting to know how can we get out the B.C.O.A.,'' Mr. Vorhees said. He laughed, presumably amused at the notion that miners could affect the coal industry's 30-year-old multi-employer bargaining coaliton. Negotiations Set to Resume\n\nBut more than the miners may be about to tear apart the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, Bargaining is scheduled to resume in Washington on Tuesday between Mr. Church and B.R. Brown, the the chief industry negotiator. If the talks do not quickly yield a new contract proposal that is acceptable to the Appalachian rank and file, the seeming certainty another long strike - there was a 111-day walkout three years ago - is expected to bring renewed pressure from within the industry to dissolve the 30-year-old practice of industrywide contracts.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Alabama, all areas where the contract was decisively rejected, and where history has shown that union resistance weakens little with the passage of time, union militancy may inspire the industry to dissolve the coal operators' association and return to the old and chaotic pattern of company-by-company bargaining.\n\nIf that should happen, members of Mr. Vorhees's 700-member local here, which voted by 387 to 72 to accept the contract, could go back to work.\n\n''A lot of my guys here are needing work,'' Mr. Vorhees said. ''In Appalachia there is a lot of tradition based on the memory of things gone by.'' Church Says He Was Mistaken\n\nMr. Church has said that he was mistaken in believing that the union mine workers in Appalachian, a majority of all union members, would accept a number of ''emotional changes'' in the proposed contract that he sent to them for approval.\n\nBut one of Mr. Church's controversial concessions, in which he gave up the usual contract requirement that work given to subcontractors be performed by union members, was mandated by the Federal courts.\n\nIn another concession, the union was to give up the payments to the joint union-management health and retirment fund of per-ton royalties on coal purchased from nonunion suppliers. But that clause had previously been sidestepped by the industry through the formation of corporate subsidiaries that were not legally tied to the contract's terms.\n\nIn return for giving up the contract language on so-called ''purchased coal,'' a clause that had brought the union welfare fund a total of $54 million in rotalty payments since it was introduced in 1964, Mr. Church obtained from the industry a plan to pay thousands of widows of miners a pension of $100 a month, at a total industry cost of $100 million in the first year. 'Think They Are Being Had'\n\n''The resentment in Appalachia is that, no matter what happens, they think they are being had by the companies,'' Mr. Vorhees said. ''Out here, we understood that Sam Church made some damn good tradeoffs.\n\n''What's the real situation back East?'' Mr. Vorhees asked. ''They must have squirrel hunting season on in West Virginia or something.''\n\nIllustrations: Photo of coal miners Map of U.S.A.",

Here he takes on three of the composer’s most important song cycles: “Winter Words,” “Michelangelo Sonnets,” and “Six Hölderlin Fragments.” Also included are selections from his penultimate group of songs, “Who are these Children?,” and the guitar-accompanied “Songs From the Chinese.”\n\nThese are very different sets, each with its own musical syntax and emotional layers — austerity in the Hölderlin, wariness of death in “Winter Words,” ardent passion in the Michaelangelo. Bostridge, though, penetrates directly to the essence of each. Over the years, his famously willowy vocal tone seems to have darkened and become more substantial, but the unique way in which he absorbs and expresses the texts’ meaning is thrillingly intact. Antonio Pappano does something similar at the piano, a fully equal partner rather than an accompanist. Xufei Yang is the resourceful guitarist in “Songs from the Chinese.”",

        "instruction": "TOMORROW is the 100th anniversary of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's birth, and television is continuing its weeklong spurt of retrospectives and reviews concerning the President who led this country through the Great Depression and most of World War II.\n\nBy far the most ambitious and extensive of the presentations is the three-hour ''F.D.R.'' being offered tonight, beginning at 8, on ABC-TV. With Richard Richter and Robert E. Frye as senior producers, the program assesses the impact President Roosevelt had on the American Presidency and on the conduct of domestic and foreign policy. Adding weight to the proceedings will be the appearances, in separate interviews, of President Reagan and former Presidents Carter, Ford and Nixon. ABC News maintains that this is the first time America's four living Presidents have been interviewed for one television program.\n\nDavid Brinkley, who was filmed at the Roosevelt home in Hyde Park, N.Y., is the chief correspondent. The consultants and participants include the historians Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., James MacGregor Burns and Robert Dallek. Interviews with specialists and former Roosevelt aides are mixed with photographs and archival film footage to achieve a valuable portrait of the man and his age.\n\nTomorrow at 8 P.M., WNET-TV is offering a two-hour package titled ''The New Deal Spirit: Films of the F.D.R. Era.'' A conversation between Richard D. Heffner, the Rutgers professor of communications and public policy, and Joseph P. Lash, the author of ''Eleanor and Franklin,'' about the life and times of the nation's 32d President, will be wrapped around reruns of three short films: ''The River'' (1937), a study of the Mississippi by Pare Lorentz; ''Artist at Work'' (1981), a film about W.P.A. programs by Mary Lance, and ''The Battle of San Pietro'' (1944), John Huston's World War II documentary.\n\nEarlier tomorrow, starting at 2 P.M., WNET offers two unusual panel discussions produced by independent videomakers associated with Jason Films and Global Village. The first hour is ''What's Left of the Left?''; the second asks ''What's Right for the Right?'' Both programs are moderated, in a bare-bones studio setting, by David Schoenbrun, the veteran broadcast journalist.\n\nPondering the future of radical movements, the left side of the spectrum is represented by Arthur Kinoy and William Kunstler, the lawyers; June Jordan, the poet and playwright; Andrea Dworkin, the feminist; Michael Harrington, the writer, and the Rev. Benjamin R. Chavis Jr., the civil rights activist. After agreeing that the old left, the coalition of workers, black and intellectuals forged under F.D.R., has largely disintegrated, the participants generally fall back on their own specific concerns and methods. Miss Dworkin keeps returning to the plight of the woman's movement. Mr. Chavis talks toughly about capitalist bloodsuckers and organizational mechanisms. Mr. Kunstler is looking for the left to get back on the streets because ''the Government will only react to fear.''\n\nMiss Jordan, seeking precise definitions, shys away from labels. ''We have to get away from this language, which turns people deaf,'' she urges. Finally, there is some recognition that the left needs some sort of ''unification.'' As Mr. Harrington says, ''The mere existence of oppression and the mere existence of struggle do not guarantee success.''\n\nThe discussion on the right is a much tidier affair, featuring Representative John H. Rousselot, Republican of California; Edward E. Clark, the libertarian; Willa Ann Johnson of the American Heritage Foundation; James E. Johnson, the host of a cable-television series; Richard A. Viguerie, the author and fund-raiser, and Patrick Buchanan, a former aide to President Nixon and now a syndicated columnist. There are some differences between the speakers, but generally they endorse the same policies, from limited government and less taxation to forceful dealing with the ''threat of the Soviet empire.'' Taken in tandem, the two hours provide valuable insights to movements outside the great political middle. Mr. Schoenbrun is a knowledgeable and efficient moderator.",

        "instruction": "THE latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, published yesterday, reveals the barriers President Reagan will face in getting his economic program through Congress and convincing the public that he knows how to bring inflation under control. Two-thirds of the respondents said they believed the economy was the nation's most important problem. Despite this concern and Mr. Reagan's long campaign for a cut in personal income taxes by 30 percent in the next three years, the poll found that 70 percent of the public prefers a balanced budget to a tax cut.\n\nBut this finding should not come as too much of a shock. There is a remarkable consistency of public attitudes on economic and budgetary matters. Back in 1963, when President Kennedy was campaigning for a big tax cut to get the economy growing again, the Democrats ran into the same public resistance to having taxes cut, rather than having the Federal budget balanced.\n\nWalter W. Heller, then chairman of President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, said the public resistance to a tax cut was a result of what he called ''the Puritan ethic.'' At the personal level, this doctrine was poetically embodied in the counsel of Shakespeare's Polonius: ''Neither a borrower nor a lender be.'' At the level of national fiscal policy, the Puritan ethic meant: Balance the budget, stay out of debt, live within your means.\n\nBut at the personal level, American Puritanism has paradoxically accompanied a growing mountain of debt. Consumer installment debt has risen from $22 billion in 1950 to $376 billion at the end of 1980. During the same 30-year period, mortgage debt has climbed from $73 billion to $1,419 billion.\n\nAt the Federal level, the public's avowed stubbornness about debt has nonetheless paralleled the rise in the public debt from $1 billion in 1910 to $24 billion after World War I to $270 billion after World War II and to $909 billion in November 1980. President Reagan has already announced his intention to ask for a rise in the debt limit to $985 billion, and most budget experts think the debt limit will have to go above $1 trillion before the end of the year.\n\nNet interest payments on the public debt, which were $14 billion as recently as 1968, will reach an estimated $67 billion in 1981, constituting a little over 10 percent of total budget outlays. Not only the annual budget deficits but also inflation and soaring interest rates explain the ballooning cost of servicing the public debt.\n\nNevertheless, despite the long binge of personal and public borrowing, the American public remains devoted to the Puritan ethic, according to the polls. Discontent over inflation and high interest charges has probably deepened the public's Puritan morality in its heart of hearts, if not in practice.\n\nThe question for Mr. Reagan, however, is how seriously to take this revealed public preference for balanced budgets over tax cuts. What would the public accept to balance the budget? Ask for higher taxes? Hardly likely, especially if, as most economists think, that would dump the economy into deeper recession. Ask for big cuts in Federal spending programs? Here, too, relatively few of those polled were in favor of specific spending cuts now under consideration. Less than a majority favored cuts in food stamps; one person out of four wanted decreases in benefits for college students or in unemployment compensation; one out of six wanted trims in outlays for controlling pollution, mass transit or highways, and only one person out of every dozen polled - 8 percent - favored cuts in Social Security benefits. Even Budget Director David A. Stockman's proposal for major cuts in foreign aid, which has only a small domestic constituency, has run into strong opposition that includes Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.\n\nSince Mr. Reagan has made clear that he means to increase, not cut, defense expenditures, he obviously has a tough job ahead if he means to cut the budget. Earlier this week he reaffirmed his intention to cut spending and taxes ''hand in hand.'' And he told interviewers in the Oval Office that ''one of the things that I have not retreated from is the 1983 target'' of a balanced budget.\n\nHowever, what President Reagan has not yet done, judging by the latest poll, is to convince the public that cutting taxes is the road to faster growth, higher tax receipts and a balanced budget. That preference for a balanced budget over tax cuts may represent not just Puritan ethics or a lack of fiscal sophistication but worry about worsened inflation. The latest Times/CBS News poll showed that only one person out of four thinks Mr. Reagan will be able to keep prices from going up all the time.\n\nMr. Reagan has a job of public education cut out for him in his coming two television addresses on the economy and the State of the Union. The stock market, which has been declining since Inauguration Day, could also use a bit of enlightenment as it contemplates a slight and probably temporary lessening of inflation at the expense of a sagging economy.",

        "instruction": "After a television season in which two Fox reality shows included strong hints that contestants were engaging in oral sex, and profanities seemed to slip past network censors with ease, a group backed by business leaders and former government officials plans to announce an effort today to pressure the big entertainment companies to be more responsive to parents' concerns.\n\nThe new group, called Common Sense Media, is introducing a Web-based media ratings system, devised with help from the publishers of the Zagat guides, that will rank entertainment products based on language, violence, sexual content and adult themes. Eventually, the group would like to spearhead the adoption of easy-to-understand parental guidelines to television shows, movies, albums and video games, to replace a hodgepodge of systems overseen by the various industries.\n\nCommon Sense says it has an initial investment of $500,000, and its backers have pledged more. Among the financial backers of the project are Charles R. Schwab, the brokerage company executive; Philip F. Anschutz, the founder of Qwest Communications International and a major owner of movie theaters; George R. Roberts, a co-founder of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company; and James G. Coulter, a founding partner in the Texas Pacific Group investment firm.\n\nTwo former chairmen of the Federal Communications Commission, William E. Kennard and Newton N. Minow, sit on its board, as does Millard S. Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew. ''There is a huge amount of frustration among parents, including myself, that the media are not giving parents enough information to judge what's appropriate for our kids,'' Mr. Kennard said.\n\n''We envision this organization, first, to give parents a way to protect themselves, to judge what's coming into their home; second, to give them a chance to channel their frustration to people who know how to influence policy.'' (Mr. Kennard also sits on the board of The New York Times Company.)\n\nCommon Sense will ask users of its Web site to enroll as members for a suggested donation of $25. ''We want to create a huge constituency for parents and kids in the same way that Mothers Against Drunk Driving or the AARP has done,'' said James P. Steyer, the founder of Common Sense and author of ''The Other Parent,'' a book about the effects of media on children. ''We can pressure the media industry itself, and the now completely dormant F.C.C., to balance the public interest.''\n\nWhile children's advocates applaud Common Sense's object, some say it is an unrealistic one.\n\nOther media watchdog and activist groups have yet to achieve sustained significant influence on government media policy or the way entertainment companies market their wares. And not many parents have made use of devices, like the V-chips for television, that allow them to block content they deem objectionable.\n\n''Their attentions are divided; they've got a whole other set of issues they have to be concerned with, though media is certainly one of them,'' said Kathryn C. Montgomery, a leader in the fight for television content ratings in the late 1990's and the president of the Center for Media Education, a children's advocacy group. ''Whether they can be mobilized effectively around a broad set of good policy goals for the future of the media still remains a question.''\n\nTo assess the level of concern among parents, Common Sense commissioned a poll from Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, the polling firm, which last month interviewed 1,000 parents with at least one child between the ages of 2 and 17 living at home. The firm said 64 percent believed that media products in general were inappropriate for their families. It said that 81 percent expressed concern that the media in general were encouraging violent, or antisocial behavior in children. The firm said that only one out of five interviewed ''fully trusted'' the separate industry-controlled ratings systems for music, movies, video games and television.\n\n''The current system doesn't work for parents, that's clear,'' said Mr. Steyer, who is also the founder of the Children Now advocacy group and a lecturer at Stanford University\n\nCommon Sense and its guide are not the first of their kinds. The Parents Television Council, a nonpartisan group that is now 800,000-strong and is run by L. Brent Bozell III -- who also runs a conservative group that seeks to flag liberal bias in the news media -- has a Web site (www.parentstv.org) that rates television content. And the Catholic League occasionally weighs in on what it believes to be inappropriate content.\n\nMr. Steyer said that he wanted to work with all the activist groups but that Common Sense's roster of supporters and advisers gives it serious influence with regulators and industry leaders.\n\nAnd, he said, unlike others that focus mainly on television, movies or video games, the Common Sense site (www.CommonSenseMedia.org) will include staff-written reviews of movies, TV shows, popular music, books, Internet sites and video games. It will also include reviews submitted to the site by parents and children -- those would contribute to a separate consumer rankings.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Tim Zagat, co-chairman of Zagat Surveys, said he agreed to help with the project because ''an awful lot of what children are exposed to and sold in this country is utter garbage.''\n\nBut the approach of Common Sense is likely to run into resistance from the industries it aims to monitor.\n\n''I don't know how you could have a single one that could apply to everybody,'' said Jack Valenti, the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, a group that devised the current movie rating system and participated in the creation of the television ratings system. ''A video game is a hell of a lot different from 'Friends' on television, and 'Friends' is a lot different from movies.''\n\nMr. Valenti, who pointed to research he had from another firm, the Opinion Research Corporation, showing parents overwhelmingly trusted the movie ratings system, also said the Common Sense Web site was vulnerable to being overtaken by ''zealots.''\n\n''The chances are that people who get on that Web site every day making judgments about movies are going to be the ones who say it's vulgar, unwholesome, terrifying -- and the world is going to hell in a handbasket,'' he said.\n\nMr. Steyer said the Web site was designed to protect against infiltration by groups with agendas, including film or television companies.\n\n''It will be very good for Mr. Valenti and his friends in the industry to hear what parents really feel about the current rating system and some of the products that their kids are being exposed to,'' Mr. Steyer said.\n\nPhotos: Common Sense Media is trying to provide clear ratings to help parents determine whether media products are suitable for their children. Among the offerings that it has already rated for language, violence and adult themes are, clockwise from top left: the rapper 50 Cent; the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; the film ''XXX''; and the TV show ''Jenny Jones.'' (Clockwise from top left, Associated Press; Rockstar Games; MurrayClose/Columbia Pictures; Associated Press) Chart: ''Litany of Labels'' Different ratings systems for various media have evolved to allow for a common understanding of content before exposure to movies, music, television programs and video games. MOVIES 1968 G M R X A rating system with four codes is born: G for general audiences, M for mature audiences (changed to PG soon after), R for restricted audiences (children under 16 are not permitted without a parent or guardian) and X, which is restricted to people 17 or older. 1984 PG-13 PG-13 is added for movies with stronger content, as a caution aimed at younger viewers. 1990 NC-17 X The X rating is changed to NC-17, for no one 17 or under allowed. MUSIC 1985 PARENTAL ADVISORY The Radio Industry Association of America agrees to label music with explicit lyrics, including depictions of violence and sex. VIDEO GAMES 1994 EC E T A RP M In an effort to fend off regulators, the Entertainment Software Rating Board was formed and uses these codes to rate all games submitted to it: EC for early childhood, E for everyone, T for teenagers, M for mature, A for adults only, and RP for rating pending. TELEVISION 1996 TVY; TVY7; TVG; TVPG; TV14; TVM The television industry unveils its ratings system, one month ahead of schedule. The ratings range from TV-Y, for all children, to TV-M, for adults only. 1997 The TV industry and family advocacy groups agree to add code letters to the new rating system: V for violence, S for sexual content, L for vulgar language, D for suggestive dialogue, and FV for fantasy violence.

The new group, called Common Sense Media, is introducing a Web-based media ratings system, devised with help from the publishers of the Zagat guides, that will rank entertainment products based on language, violence, sexual content and adult themes. Eventually, the group would like to spearhead the adoption of easy-to-understand parental guidelines to television shows, movies, albums and video games, to replace a hodgepodge of systems overseen by the various industries."

WALKER.\n\nON BOARD H.B.M. STEAM SLOOP ICARUS, TRUXILLO, Tuesday, Aug. 21, 1860.\n\nSIR: I have to inform you --\n\n1. That the Custom-house receipts of the port of Truxillo, mortgaged to the British Government in payment of a debt for which that Government made itself answerable, are diverted from their proper course by your unauthorized occupation of that port.\n\n2. That the sum of $2,025 in money and Government paper to the amount of $1,390, left in the Custom-house on your taking possession of the town, belong to the British Government, in virtue of said mortgage.\n\n3. That in consequence of the entire cessation of trade, caused by your occupation of the town, the interests of the British merchants at Balize are affected to a large amount.\n\n4. That your presence on this coast has been the means of deferring the completion of a treaty existing between Great Britain and Honduras.\n\nThat, therefore, I consider it my duty, in protection of the interests of Great Britain, to reestablish in Truxillo the authorities commissioned by the existing Government of Honduras, and request that you, with your followers, will be prepared to lay down your arms and reembark on the recognized officials being ready to resume their posts. Such arms and all military stores belonging to the expedition, to be forfeited to the Honduras Government, as a surety against any further descents on their coasts. Officers to retain their side arms. Also, to deliver up to the proper authorities the money and paper mentioned in clause two, as well as all the Government papers. Upon these terms being complied with, safety to person and private property will be guaranteed by the English flag.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nGEN. WALKER TO COMMANDER SALMON.\n\nTo Capt. NORVELL SALMON, of H.B.M.'s steam sloop Icarus:\n\nSIR -- I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date, sent to me through Lieutenant COXE, of Her Britannic Majesty's navy.\n\nSome of the facts contained in your communication are new to me; and had they been known to me I should not have undertaken to modify the Custom-house regulations of this port.\n\nI must beg leave to say that I was entirely ignorant of the mortgage to the British Government of the Custom-house receipts at this port. Assuredly I have no intention to divert from their proper course any funds mortgaged to the British crown. If any Custom-house receipts have been lost during my presence here, it has not been in the interests of British subjects, as most of the trade here during my occupation has been carried on by vessels bearing the British flag.\n\nIn relation to the money-said to have been left in the Custom-house, as well as the Government paper, I have to say that I have not seen nor heard of one or the other. Had I received such money or paper, they should be immediately delivered to you, on the statement you make concerning the mortgage to the British Crown.\n\nAs to the injury done to British trade by my occupation of this town, I must be permitted to say that I am convinced that any trifling injury now done would be ten-fold repaired by future benefits to English commerce. This, however, involves questions not necessary to discuss at present.\n\nTouching the fulfillment of the treaty stipulations between Great Britain and Honduras, I must reply that no one can be more anxious than myself for the complete carrying out of the treaty of the 36th November, 1859. It was in expectation of this treaty's having been fully carried out that I visited Ruatan in the month of June last; and excuse me if, in this connection, I refer to what you call my unauthorized occupation of this port.\n\nIt would be a long story for me to tell you why I claim the right to make war on the existing authorities of Honduras. Suffice it to say that my presence here at this time is due entirely to the engagements which I consider I had in honor contracted; with a people destrous of living in Central America under the ancient laws and customs of the English realm, claiming with them common interests under the institutions derived from the code of ALFRED. I thought it no wrong to assist them in the maintenance of rights they had lawfully acquired.\n\nAsking pardon for so long dwelling on the statements of your letter, I have to reply that if you deem it your duty to reestablish the former authorities of this port, I shall do nothing consistent with honor to prevent your execution of what you think a duty. As to the terms you propose, I cannot, under the circumstances, regard if dishonorable to lay down my arms to an officer of the British crown, inasmuch as many of the persons compromised by their adherence to me may claim the guarantees of English subjects. In regard to our embarking, you do not specify on what vessel or at whose expense such reembarkation is to take place. Concerning the money and paper, I can only say that, as they never came into my possession, it is imposible for me to deliver them up.",

        "instruction": "Deal talk has exchange stocks grooving. But more mergers spell disaster for markets already tilted dangerously in favor of big companies and fast traders.\n\nShares of NYSE Euronext NYX surged 14% Wednesday after the New York Stock Exchange parent said it was in advanced discussions to merge with Germany’s biggest exchange, Deutsche Borse of Frankfurt. The talks come on the heels of this week’s tie-up between the London Stock Exchange and Canada’s TMX Group.\n\nThe deal is feeding some long-awaited gains for investors in exchange operators, which were hot in the late stages of the last stock market run-up but have cooled considerably since (see chart, right). Among the big gainers Wednesday were the other big U.S. exchange operators, including the Nasdaq Ndaq , up 6%, the CBOE cboe , up 5%, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange cme , up 2%.\n\nBut bigger stock exchanges don’t bring good tidings for the rest of us. Indeed, another round of exchange mergers will only intensify problems that skeptics have been railing about for years – particularly since last spring’s Flash Crash.\n\nThe stock markets, critics contend, no longer serve the purpose they were created to serve, helping small and midsize companies grow by raising capital cheaply from the public.\n\nInstead, the big exchanges increasingly battle one another to serve the biggest companies — and to bring in low-margin trading volume that comes as often as not from computers seeking out freebies like trading rebates.\n\nLike their cousins the too-big-to-fail banks, the exchanges now profit as much at the expense of the U.S. economy as to its benefit. Is this transformation — culminating in a merger creating a company to be incorporated in the Netherlands — what has become of the fabled U.S. stock market that started in 1792 under a buttonwood tree? Say it ain’t so.\n\n“You see a lot more volume on the stock exchanges, but it’s mostly short-term traders playing games,” said Sal Arnuk of institutional broker Themis Trading. “That actually deters long-term investing.”\n\nEver since the stock exchanges were allowed a decade or so ago to turn themselves from client-centered mutual organization to profit-maximizing public companies, stock market listings and initial public offerings have dwindled.\n\nMeanwhile, the exchanges have grown bigger through successive rounds of mergers. Driven to show returns to their shareholders, the exchanges went from serving small companies trying to raise capital, to catering to big companies and, increasingly, fast, high-volume traders.\n\n“The market structure is optimized for big-cap companies,” David Weild, a senior adviser to consulting firm Grant Thornton who was a vice chairman at the Nasdaq. “Everyone who looks at it is coming to the same conclusion.”\n\nThese shifts, along with rules that narrowed the bid-asked spreads on stock trades and deregulated financial services companies, have led to a long series of unintended consequences that turned the public markets into more and more of a casino.\n\nIn typical fashion, regulators and legislators sought to bring low-cost investing to Main Street – but didn’t realize what else might come along for the ride. Welcome to Vegas.\n\n“Over the past decade, the exchanges have fragmented and split off like bacteria,” said Arnuk. “And every change has been in favor of the fast trading model that you saw from the Dateks of the world in the late 1990s.”\n\nThe question now is how to fix it. Arnuk questions the for-profit exchange model, saying the exchanges should be utilities that look after their customers and the markets, rather than acting like bonus-seeking bankers.\n\nOthers consider ideas like an SEC-backed exchange that would focus on the needs of small companies. But that is not an easy sell at a time when the SEC is writing new rules by the dozen and under the gun for its failures in the Madoff, Stanford and Petters Ponzi schemes.\n\nWhat’s clear, though, is that the current system isn’t working and someone has to fix it.\n\n“We solved the problem of investors paying too much to trade stocks, but we traded it for a problem that hurts the economy,” said Weild. “We need to rethink how we do this.”",

        "instruction": "BARCELONA, Spain, July 21— The United Nations Security Council informed the Spanish Government tonight that athletes from Yugoslavia would be welcome to compete in the Barcelona Olympics in individual events without national identification, but not in team sports.\n\nBut Yugoslav Olympic officials suggested they might withdraw from the Games rather than comply.\n\nThe decision was made to allow Spain to comply with sanctions, which prevent members of the United Nations from allowing athletes who represent Yugoslavia to participate in international sports events. The United Nations has identified Yugoslavia as the aggressor in the current civil war.\n\nIn the ruling, from the sanctions committee of the Security Council in New York, individual athletes can compete in the Games, provided they do not participate as a group, gather for any group appearances or march in any ceremonies with the Yugoslav flag or anthem.\n\nAny violation of those terms, said Matthew Nerzig, a United Nations spokesman, would become \"grounds for expulsion of the athletes from the Games.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear, however, whether those conditions would satisfy the Yugoslavia Olympic Committee, whose secretary general tonight left open the possibility that Yugoslavia, now just the two republics of Serbia and Montenegro, would send no athletes, rather than a fractured team. The prohibition of team competitions would eliminate more than half the 118 athletes Yugoslavia was prepared to send.\n\n\"We will study this matter tomorrow, and our president will make a decision,\" Caslav Veljic, the secretary general, said from Belgrade. \"It is my opinion, that we say, 'Thank you very much for the invitation, but rather than be present with no name, no country, no flag, we will not come.' If everybody is against Yugoslavia, we can live without them. Goodbye. It is very stupid to ask that we divide our team.\"\n\nMeanwhile, one of the two members of the International Olympic Committee from Yugoslavia, Slobodan Filipovic, said tonight that he would ask the I.O.C. to request an extraordinary session of the Security Council in an attempt to change the decision of the sanctions committee. Bound to Obey\n\n\"This is a really difficult decision for the Yugoslavian Olympic Committee,\" Filipovic said. \"It is good for any athlete to compete in the Olympics Games. But it is also important to think about solidarity.\"\n\nAs a member of the United Nations, Spain is bound to observe the sanctions, but the I.O.C. has obliged itself to maximize Olympic participation for as many athletes as possible.\n\nIn addressing concerns of the sanctions committee raised earlier, the I.O.C. proposed that all Yugoslavs could compete under the banner of the Independent Team, a nonpolitical designation, and march into the opening and closing ceremonies by the white Olympic flag with five rings.\n\nThat solution satisfied the sanctions committee only so far as individuals were concerned. Some committee members still had serious reservations about team events -- Yugoslavia qualified for men's and women's handball, men's water polo and women's basketball -- and it was on the basis of those concerns that the split decision was rendered.\n\nThe I.O.C. delayed any response tonight, pending its own discussion during a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday morning.\n\nIn essence, the I.O.C. members have more of a philosophical question to debate, rather than a practical one, in that Spain must follow the United Nations mandate. Which Way to Go\n\n\"The debate is whether we get Yugoslavia to the Games in some form,\" said Kevan Gosper of Australia, an I.O.C. vice president, \"or do we protest the discriminatory decision of having individuals, not teams. Do we take the whole team, or do we say some are better than none? That's the dilemma.\"\n\nThe I.O.C., he said, also must factor the notion that, as sponsor of the Olympics, it makes no distinction between individual athletes and those who compete as part of a team. Just as an individual athlete receives a gold medal, so does each member of a victorious team.\n\nWhatever decisions are reached here and in Belgrade, they are not likely to affect teams from two former Yugoslav repubics, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. Their athletes are waiting to learn from the I.O.C. under what conditions they will be allowed to compete, either as separate teams or as one and under what name and flag.",

        "instruction": "NEW YORK — When the New York Stock Exchange’s systems went down during the trading day last week, few longtime employees who had helped lead the exchange during past problems were on hand.\n\nSince Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, bought the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, the Atlanta company has cut hundreds of workers, including almost everyone in the exchange’s top ranks.\n\nThe disruption last week, more than three hours, has drawn attention to how quick and deep the cuts have been. In a little more than a year, ICE shed 800 jobs, or about 40 percent of the workforce at NYSE-Euronext, the New York exchange’s parent company. It also sold off Euronext, a network of European stock exchanges; renovated the exchange’s building at 11 Wall St.; and moved out of the building next door at 20 Broad St., the old home of the American Stock Exchange.\n\nICE, which has grown into a juggernaut via acquisitions, is known for its relentless focus on cost-cutting and efficiency. But the reductions in New York are under scrutiny because of the possibility they left the exchange without enough experienced people to manage a crisis.\n\nA spokeswoman for ICE, Kelly Loeffler, said the cuts obscured larger investments ICE has made in New York, including the use of employees from Atlanta, who had provided support for the exchange’s technology and helped build new trading software coming soon. Loeffler said most of the current hiring is being done in New York.\n\nOther technical snags that same Wednesday — most notably a computer failure that temporarily grounded all United Airlines flights — raised concerns about hackers. But exchange officials said then and have maintained since that the technical problems were caused by updates they were making to the software. Other exchanges were unaffected, allowing stock trades to continue almost uninterrupted.\n\nBut questions about the shutdown grew because it took the New York exchange nearly four hours to get its old system back online, longer than most recent technical disruptions at other exchanges.\n\n“If your crown jewel is down for four hours, that is a really bad statement,” said Jeffrey Wallis, a veteran market structure analyst.\n\nSome traders said it was hard to get information from the New York exchange about the problem and how long it would take to fix it. Senior workers who had served as the go-between with traders during past disruptions left over the last year.\n\nLoeffler said the exchange still had 150 workers, many of them with long histories on the floor. And the exchange won praise from some large banks, saying they were given regular updates during the failure.\n\n“NYSE’s communications with the industry were proactive and helpful,” a JPMorgan Chase executive wrote to clients the next day.\n\nThe fate of the New York exchange was a hot topic when ICE said it was buying NYSE-Euronext in 2012 for $8.2 billion. The chief executive of ICE, Jeffrey Sprecher, has said he is committed to keeping open the trading floor, and he promised to keep dual headquarters in New York and Atlanta. But he was clear from the first day that he would cut costs.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON — Citing a potential threat to public health, the Food and Drug Administration is taking steps toward phasing out the use of some antibiotics in animals processed for meat.\n\nMany cattle, hog, and poultry producers give their animals antibiotics regularly to ensure that they are healthy and to make the animals grow faster. Now, the agency has said that it will ask pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily stop labeling drugs important for treating human infection as acceptable for that growth promotion in animals.\n\nIf the companies sign on — and one major company has already said it will — using those antibiotics to promote growth in animals would be illegal. Prescriptions would be required to use the drugs for ill animals.\n\nThe FDA has been debating how to address the issue of antibiotics in meat for several years as consumers have become more aware of the issue and are asking for antibiotic-free meat.\n\nMcDonald’s, among other companies, has moved to limit the drugs in their meat, pushing many animal producers to go along. The restaurant chain Chipotle also has tried to use meat raised without antibiotics, but has cited challenges in finding enough of it.\n\nThe FDA move is designed to limit antibiotic-resistant diseases in humans. Repeated exposure to antibiotics can lead germs to become resistant to the drugs so that they are no longer effective in treating a particular illness.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem. In September the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released sobering estimates that more than 23,000 people a year are dying from drug-resistant infections. The biggest risk is from germs spread in hospitals, and it’s not clear how much of the problem is related to the use of drugs in meat.\n\nStill, the FDA says this is one step toward decreasing resistance. ‘‘We need to be selective about the drugs we use in animals and when we use them,’’ said William Flynn of FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. ‘‘Antimicrobial resistance may not be completely preventable, but we need to do what we can to slow it down.’’\n\nThe new guidance will give the companies three years to comply.\n\nMichael Taylor, FDA’s deputy commissioner of foods, said he believes asking industry to make the changes is the fastest way to help phase the drugs out. If the FDA made the process mandatory, he said, the agency would have had to move forward with a complex regulatory process that could take years.\n\n‘‘We have high confidence based on dialogue with industry that this initiative will succeed,’’ Taylor said.\n\nDrug company Zoetis, a leading manufacturer of animal antibiotics, has already said it will comply. ‘‘This reflects our continued commitment to antibiotic stewardship and represents the many ways that Zoetis promotes the responsible use of antimicrobial drugs in animals,’’ the company’s statement said.\n\nMany animal groups signaled support for the FDA guidance after it was announced Wednesday, including the National Pork Producers Council.",

Under-the-table prizes for top finishers in last month's marathon have been reported at $14,000 to the winner and $8,000 to the first woman across the line.\n\nBill Rodgers, a four-time winner of the race is reported to earn about $250,000 a year, including income from his running-related sporting goods stores.\n\nFred Lebow, the race's director and president of the New York Road Runners Club, has said that the club purchased $10,000 worth of running clothes from Rodgers's firm before last year's race and that Rodgers was paid $5,000 for each of a series of personal appearances related to the event.\n\nNo check is placed directly into the hands of a competitor as prize money because doing so would endanger the athlete's amateur status. Obviously there's hypocrisy here: Athletes living off the fruits of competition, like professionals, while remaining amateurs. The hypocrisy exists because of the Olympic Games. The Olympics in and of themselves are not hypocritical; but they create hypocrisy for those gifted athletes who can use the Games to establish a basis for personal wealth.\n\nIf the Games did not exist, track and field stars and other athletes, such as Alpine skiiers, could openly accept fees won in competition. But because the Games do exist, these athletes must maintain the sham of amateurism in order to remain eligible to win Olympic medals that could form the basis for fees they can demand under the table at European track and field meets or to determine what they can extract, such as from ski equipment manufacturers, for using and endorsing gear. Who knows what the American boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow might have cost Rodgers?\n\nTennis and golf, once dominated by amateurs, had little trouble converting to ''open'' competition because neither is an Olympic sport (though tennis once was more than a half-century ago and will be again, in 1988 at Seoul, South Korea). Wimbledon, for example, opened its competitions to both professional and amateur players, offering prize money and ending the rampant ''shamateurism'' within tennis.\n\nThe enterprising few stars in track and field and skiing are not reason enough for theirs and the other Olympic disciplines to be forced to go the way of Wimbledon. The restrictive reactions against these few sports has already hurt athletes in other Olympic sports, but despite the wailing about Olympic hypocrisy it should be noted that the Games are still primarily the property of the amateurs in lesser-known sports such as cycling, fencing, field hockey and speed skating. Without the Olympics, these athletes would never have their international moment.\n\nHow many of us would have the slightest interest in or knowledge of speed skating if it weren't for Eric Heiden's performances at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980?\n\nOf course, any competitor has the right to create as much income as is possible by means of his or her athletic talent; but why criticize the Olympic Games, as has been done, for not changing the rules to accommodate them? If athletes condemn the Games and their standards, they have the right to ignore them, which they won't do because medals won are so helpful in establishing a financial base.\n\nOn the other hand the International Olympic Committee recently acted to alleviate the discriminatory aspects of their rules that place varying financial pressures on amateur athletes, depending on their sport. After conferring with representatives from the 147 Olympic nations at the 11th Olympic Congress at Baden-Baden, West Germany, last September, the I.O.C. told the 26 international sporting federations who compete in the Games to set definitions of amateurism for themselves, according to each federation's needs, which would also be applied to Olympic eligibility.\n\nThe action expanded on the present rules and sanctified what had already been applied by several federations on their own. The I.O.C. will collect each set of rules, and if those rules set within certain broad limits (no prize money) athletes can receive liberal, though not unlimited, subsidization while training and competing.\n\nThe wisdom of allowing each federation to establish its own requirement lies in the diversity of fund-raising capability within amateur sporting federations. In the United States the ski team organizers are the best at funding, raising about $2 million through corporate sponsorships and city-organized fund-raisers each year to cover a $1.7 million budget. Gymnastics, basketball or figure skating events can fill arenas to collect the concomitant gate and television receipts.\n\nHowever, less popular sports, such as fencing, have very little fund-raising capacity with which they can add to the relatively inadequate $100,000 or less they receive each year from the United States Olympic Committee. Before the U.S.O.C. money was made available a few years ago, the fencers who went to international championships were not necessarily our national champions but were those who could afford to pay most of their own way abroad.",

        "instruction": "Under date of Beaufort, July 22, Mr. EDWARD L. PIERCE has written a letter describing the conduct of the negro regiment in the recent assault upon Fort Wagner. He says:\n\n\"Gen. STRONG had been impressed with the high character of the regiment and its officers, and he wished to assign them the post where the most severe work was to be done, and the highest honor was to be won. I had been his guest for some days, and knew how he regarded them. The march across Folly and Morris Islands was over a very sandy road, and was very wearisome. The regiment went through the centre of the island, and not along the beach, where the marching was easier. When they had come within 600 yards of Fort Wagner they formed in line of battle, the Colonel heading the first and the Major the second battalion. This was within musket- shot of the enemy. There was little firing from the enemy, a solid shot falling between the battalions, and another falling to the right, but no musketry. At this point the regiment, together with the next supporting regiments, the Sixth Connecticut. Ninth Maine and others, remained for half an hour. The regiment was addressed by Gen. STRONG and by Col. SHAW. Then at 7 1/2 or 7 3/4 o'clock the order for the charge was given. The regiment advanced at quick time, changed to double-quick when at some distance on. The intervening distance-between the place where the line was formed and the fort was run over in a few minutes. When within one or two hundred yards of the fort, a terrific fire of grape and musketry was poured upon them along the entire line, and with deadly results. It tore the ranks to pieces, and disconcerted some. They rallied again, went through the ditch, in which was some three feet of water, and then up the parapet. They raised the flag on the parapet, where it remained for a few minutes. Here they melted away before the enemy's fire, their bodies falling down the slope, and into the ditch. Others will give a more detailed and accurate account of what occurred during the rest of the conflict.\n\nCol. SHAW reached the parapet, leading his men, and was probably killed. Adj. JONES saw him fall. Private THOMAS BURGESS, of Company I, told me that he was close to Col. SHAW; that he waved his sword and cried out, \"Onward! Boys,\" and, as he did so, fell. BURGESS fell, wounded, at the same time. In a minute or two, as he rose to crawl away, he tried to pull Col. SHAW along, taking hold of his feet, which were near his own head, but there appeared to be no life in him. There is a report, however, that Col. SHAW is wounded and a prisoner, and that it was so stated to the officers who bore a flag of truce from us; but I cannot find it well authenticated. It is most likely that this noble youth has given his life to his country and to mankind. Brig.-Gen. STRONG (himself a kindred spirit,) said of him to-day, in a message to his parents, \"I had but little opportunity to be with him, but I already loved him. No man ever went more gallantly into battle. None knew him but to love him.\" I parted with Col. SHAW between 6 and 7 o'clock on Saturday evening, as he rode forward to his regiment, and be gave me the private letters and papers he had with him to be delivered to his father. Of the other officers, Maj. HALLOWELL is severely wounded in the groin; Adjt. JAMES has a wound from a rifle ball in his ankle, and a flesh wound in his side from a glancing ball or piece of shell. Capt. POPE has bad a musket ball extracted from his shoulder. Capt. APPLETON is wounded in the thumb, and also has a contusion on his right breast from a hand grenade, which, however, is not severe. Capt. WILLARD has a wound in the leg, and is doing well. Capt. JONES was wounded in the right shoulder. The ball went through and he is doing well. Lieut. HOMANS was wounded by a ball from a smooth bore musket entering the left side, which has been extracted from the back. He is doing well.\n\nOf the privates and non-commissioned officers I send you a list of 144 who are now in the Beaufort hospitals. A few others died on the boats or since their arrival here. There may be other at the Hilton Head Hospital, and others are doubtless on Morris Island; but I have no names or statistics relative to them. Those in Beaufort are well attended to, just as well as the white soldiers, the attentions of the surgeons and nurses being supplemented by those of the colored people here, who have shown a great interest in them. The men of the regiment are very patient, and where their condition at all permits them, are cheerful. They expressed their readiness to meet the enemy again, and they keep asking if Wagner is yet taken. Could any one from the North see these brave fellows as they lie here, their prejudice against them, if he had any, would all pass away. They grieve greatly at the loss of Col. SHAW, who seems to have acquired a strong hold on their affections.\n\nThey are attached to their other officers, and admire Gen. STRONG, whose courage was so conspicuous to all. I asked Gen. STRONG if he had any testimony in relation to the regiment to be communicated to you. These are his precise words, and I give them to you as I noted them at the time:\n\n\"The Fifty-fourth did well and nobly; only the fall of Col. SHAW prevented them from entering the fort. They moved up as gallantly as any troops could, and with their enthusiasm they deserved a better fate.\" The regiment could not have been under a better officer than Gen. STRONG. He is one of the bravest and most genuine men. His soldiers loved him like a brother, and go where you would through the camps you would hear them speak of him with enthusiasm and affection. His wound is severe, and there are some apprehensions as to his being able to recover from it. Since I found him at the hospital tent on Morris Island about 9 1/2 o'clock on Saturday, I have been all the time attending to him and the officers of the Fifty-fourth, both on the boats and here. Nobler spirits it has never been my fortune to be with. Gen. STRONG, as he lay on the stretcher in the tent, was grieving all the while for the poor fellows who lay uncared for on the battle-field, and the officers of the Fifty-fourth have had nothing to say of their own misfortunes, but have mourned constantly for the hero who led them to the charge from which he did not return. I remember well the beautiful day when the flags were presented at Readville, and you told the regiment that your reputation was to be identified with its fame\". It was a day of festivity and cheer. I walk now in these hospitals, and see mutilated forms with every variety of wound, and it seems all a dream. But well has the regiment sustained the hope which you indulged, and justified the identity of fame which you trusted to it.\n\nI ought to add in relation to the fight on James Island on July 15, in which the regiment lost 50 men, driving back the rebels, and saving, as it is stated, three companies of the Tenth Connecticut, that Gen. TERRY, who was in command on that Island said to Adjt. JAMES:\n\n\"Tell your Colonel that I am exceedingly pleased with the conduct of your regiment. They have done all they could do.\"\n\nThe Twenty-fourth Massachusetts was not, as far as I can learn, engaged in the fight of Saturday evening. They were, however, present. Brig.-Gen. STEVENSON marched at the head of his brigade, where I saw him as it passed along the beach to Fort Wagner.",

        "instruction": "Support for the Irish republican cause in the United States has remained strong since the hunger strike in Northern Ireland ended, according to an official of a New York-based organization that the Justice Department says is an agent of the Irish Republican Army's Provisional wing.\n\nMartin Galvin, publicity director of the Irish Northern Aid Committee said in a recent interview that the organization had opened 10 chapters around the country in its efforts to ''promote American support for the republican aim for a free and independent Ireland.''\n\n''Thanks to Margaret Thatcher we are on a completely new plateau,'' Mr. Galvin said. He said the seven-month hunger strike at Maze Prison outside Belfast, which ended Oct. 3 after 10 inmates had died, had focused international attention on ''the colonial actions of the British occupation army'' in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the first half of this year the group, known as Noraid, raised $250,000, more than twice as much as in the same period last year, before the hunger strike. Mr. Galvin, who is an assistant district attorney for the Bronx, said donations so far in the second half of the year were also running ahead of the same period of last year. Dispute Over I.R.A.\n\nThe Irish and British Governments have condemned Noraid, saying it supports the I.R.A. Noraid officials deny that the group is linked to the I.R.A. and say the money it sends to Northern Ireland goes only to support the families of imprisoned I.R.A. members. Mr. Galvin referred only to the ''republican cause,'' saying that he could not speak for the I.R.A. But he did say that ''armed struggle is the only recourse against British Army violence,'' and that ''morally we support the struggle against British occupation.''\n\nSeveral Noraid officials have been arrested by Federal agents on charges of conspiring to ship weapons to Northern Ireland. In 1977, Daniel Cahalane and Neil Byrne, both officers of Noraid, were sentenced to one-year prison terms after being convicted of conspiracy and illegal exportation of arms. On Oct. 1, Michael Flannery, a Noraid director, was arrested on charges of conspiring to ship arms to the I.R.A. Next to Mr. Flannery's name on Noraid letterheads is that of Joe Cahill, who was convicted in Ireland in 1973 of gunrunning and belonging to the I.R.A. Provisional wing.\n\nThe most direct challenge to Noraid's claim that it only raises relief money is the Justice Department's effort to force the organization to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as an agent of the Provisionals. Questions About Sponsor Raised\n\nAlthough Noraid has been registered as an agent of the Northern Aid Committee in Belfast since 1971, the Justice Department said in 1977 that Noraid had failed to supply sufficient information under the registration act's rules and that it did not identify itself as the foreign principal of the Provisionals. A Justice Department official involved in the case said that Noraid had been unable to supply the address of the Northern Aid Committee in Belfast. No canceled checks made out to the Northern Aid Committee ever appeared in Noraid files, he said.\n\nAs evidence, Justice Department lawyers offered documents that included an undated flier with an Irish Northern Aid Committee letterhead, signed by Joe R. Martin, Active Service Unit 3, Belfast No. 1 Brigade, that said, ''Remember -the Irish Northern Aid Committee is the only organization in America that supports the Provisional I.R.A.''\n\nIn May, Federal Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. ruled in the Attorney General's favor to require the committee to provide more information about its activities, including documentation of its accounts. Appeal Is Pending\n\nLawyers from O'Dwyer & Bernstein, which represents Noraid, denied the Justice Department's charges and appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeals in New York on Oct. 28, saying that Judge Haight's decision threatened the First Amendment rights of Noraid's officials. The parties are awaiting a decision on the appeal.\n\nFrank Durkan of O'Dwyer & Bernstein said, ''There is no question that the U.S. Government comes down foursquare on the side of the British Government.''\n\n''In 10 years, the Justice Department cannot point to one specific dollar that is being diverted,'' Mr. Galvin said. Despite the end of the hunger strike, Noraid-sponsored protests outside the British Consulate in New York continue daily, as they have since April. The British flag has not flown there since demonstrators burned it in May. Consulate officials say the number of protestors has recently fallen below 25. The protesters chant the names of the six counties of Northern Ireland while a policeman guarding the building watches.",

But one way to save is by preparing your own produce.\n\nTake an extra few minutes to prepare your own fresh food, and you can save on inflated \"labor costs.\"\n\nIf you're looking to save, make chicken a staple of your meals. It's high in protein and low in fat, making it a healthy food powerhouse.\n\nThink about it: there's a reason that growing up, chicken tenders were always on the menu at your school cafeteria. You're welcome for that nugget of information!\n\nRealistically, you can't have chicken every night. Shake it up and hit the frozen food aisles at the grocery store.\n\nOn average, frozen fish is 30 percent cheaper than fresh fillets, and you're still getting all those healthy omega-3 fatty acids. And while you're there, pick up some frozen veggies.\n\nAfter a long day, figuring out something to cook can be overwhelming, and it can be simpler to turn to pick up a pizza.\n\nSo when your schedule is light, plan ahead and figure out what to eat for the next few days.\n\nIt'll save you the heartbreak of throwing away dollars upon dollars of spoiled produce and questionable meat.\n\nEat healthy without breaking the bank\n\nMyth: Coconut Oil is a Cure-All\n\nFact: Coconut oil is the latest miracle food. If you believe popular wellness websites, it’s good for just about everything – from making your teeth whiter, skin more luminous and hair shinier to boosting your brain and bone health and treatment for yeast infections. (Huh?!) However, according to the Food and Drug Administration, which recently sent a stern warning to a marketer of coconut oil over the brand’s misleading and unsubstantiated health and nutrition claims, coconut oil isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.\n\nAccording to registered dietitian Sonya Angelone, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, “Coconut oil’s health benefits are often credited to the medium-chain triglycerides it provides.” However, coconut oil actually contains very little – about 10 to 15 percent of all of its fat is the beneficial short-chain MCTs that contain no more than 10 carbon molecules, Angelone adds. While the major saturated fat in coconut oil is lauric acid (a 12-carbon molecule), there is insufficient published scientific evidence to suggest lauric acid provides any meaningful health benefits.\n\nCoconut oil is more than 90 percent saturated fat. Butter, a distant second, is about 65 percent saturated fat. And like all fats, it’s also high in calories, weighing in at 120 calories per tablespoon. Using coconut oil when cooking Thai dishes and others recipes that call for the tropical oil won’t harm your health, but adding coconut oil to your diet probably won’t improve it, either.\n\nMyth: “Gluten-Free” Means It’s Good for Me\n\nFact: Research shows that about one-third of U.S. adults are trying to cut down on or avoid products containing gluten, according to the NPD Group. As a result, gluten-free foods are flying off supermarket shelves. While the majority of gluten-avoiders have no medical diagnosis that suggests that they can’t digest gluten, they simply believe “gluten-free” foods are healthier than their gluten-containing counterparts.\n\nNot so fast. Following a gluten-free diet when you don’t have a diagnosis for being sensitive or allergic to gluten may put you at risk for developing vitamin deficiencies, because a gluten-free diet is often low in fiber and many essential nutrients. In fact, an Australian study reported that more than 10 percent of both men and women following a gluten-free diet had inadequate intakes of thiamin, folate, magnesium, fiber, iron and calcium in both men and women. Women were also likely to lack iron and vitamin A, and men often didn’t get enough zinc.\n\nWhat’s more, “gluten-free” versions of many foods aren’t necessarily more nutritious. Many are high in calories, added sugars and saturated fat, so it’s easy to exceed your calorie budget. \"Often, the term 'gluten-free' is used on processed foods formulated using refined gluten -free grains such as rice, potato, quinoa and tapioca,\" Angelone says. \"They often contain a significant amount of sugar and aren’t rich in nutrients or fiber.\"\n\nA healthier approach to living a gluten-free lifestyle is to focus on wholesome foods that are naturally free of gluten – including fruits, vegetables and lean proteins such as seafood, poultry and low-fat dairy.\n\nMyth: Diet Beverages Don’t Aid Weight Loss Fact: While some observational studies have reported that people who drink diet beverages are more likely to be overweight, those types of studies only show associations and can’t prove that diet beverages cause weight gain. Obesity researchers suggest results from observational studies need to consider that people who are overweight use more “diet” foods and beverages to help them lose weight, compared to normal-weight individuals.\n\nResults from two human clinical trials (which are considered the gold-standard for quality research and can be used to show cause-and-effect relationships) show weight loss benefits of diet beverages. In a 12-week study published in the journal Obesity, subjects who drank diet beverages lost, on average, 13 pounds, compared to 9 pounds lost among the water-only drinkers. The researchers also found that the diet beverage drinkers reported feeling less hungry, despite both groups following the same calorie-controlled diet regimen. Another study reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found subjects who drank diet soda or water were more than twice as likely to lose more than 5 percent of their body weight in a six-month study. So, if you’re trying to cut calories to lose weight, and you want to enjoy a diet beverage, you don’t have to worry that it will derail your efforts.\n\nMyth: Saturated Fats Aren’t Bad for Your Heart\n\nFact: If you Google “saturated fat myth,” you’ll get more than 250,000 links that highlight the “shocking” news that new data show we were wrong to recommend limiting saturated fat. However, before you start adding bacon to your burger and coconut oil to your coffee, this debate is far from over.\n\nThere's a lot of conflicting information about saturated fats, and whether or not they’re harmful to your heart, thanks to a couple reports in established journals like the Annals of Internal Medicine. These suggest diets high in saturated fat may not be that bad after all. But as numerous researchers have now pointed out, these studies have several major limitations with results that have been misinterpreted. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, reducing saturated fats can improve heart health if saturated fat is replaced with mono and polyunsaturated fats, but not when it’s replaced with refined carbohydrates. For example, diets low in saturated fat but high in added sugars and refined carbs may increase, not decrease, risk for heart disease.\n\nBased on results from numerous randomized controlled clinical trials, the American Heart Association recommends no more than 7 percent of total calories from saturated fats or 140 calories for a 2,000-calorie reference diet. To meet that recommendation, eat fewer full-fat dairy products, limit fat-rich meats and use oils that are low in saturated fat and high in monos and polys such as canola, safflower or sunflower. Canola oil can also be used in place of butter or shortening when baking to reduce saturated fat without affecting the texture of flavor. The AHA also recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 6 teaspoons (100 calories) per day for women and 9 (150 calories) for men.\n\nImage credit: Jamie Grill Photography\n\nOrthorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that involves obsessive healthy eating to the point of malnutrition.

Faye Dunaway revived her career playing the notoriously abusive screen legend, and movie-goers were scared off ever using wire hangers again.\n\nPiper Laurie earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the God-fearing, domineering mother whose physical and mental abuse helps drive her telekinetic daughter into a murderous rage. What's even scarier is that horror author Stephen King -- who wrote the novel on which the Brian De Palma-directed movie is based -- used a pair or real women as inspiration for the character.\n\nAcademy Award voters rightly honored Mo'Nique with a best supporting actress statuette for her turn as a vile single mother in 1987 Harlem in director Lee Daniel's brutal drama. Her Mary is as much tragic as detestable, perpetuating the cycle of abuse that ruined her own life upon her struggling teenage daughter.\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, when director John Frankenheimer's espionage thriller first ran in theaters, Angela Lansbury's Machiavellian matriarch must have seemed even more terrifying.\n\nAfter all, brainwashing your own son to become a Communist assassin is slightly more invasive than forcing him to eat his vegetables.\n\nAs serial killers go, Kathleen Turner's titular suburban housewife at least dispatches some of her victims for the kind of noble reason of slighting her children.\n\nBut even her own kids (played by Ricky Lake and Matthew Lilliard) know better than to get on her bad side.\n\nSpoiler alert: First it turns out that Nicole Kidman's Civil War-era matriarch killed her own children during a nervous breakdown, then she won't even let their ghosts play with the kindly spiritual medium.\n\nAnne Ramsey could easily qualify for her turn as the matriarch of the Fratelli family of gangsters in \"The Goonies,\" but gets the nod for this role because - who didn't want to throw the screechy ball of anger off a train after seeing this Danny DeVito/Billy Crystal comedy?\n\nCate Blanchett proved the perfect fit as the wicked stepmother in Disney's live action adaptation of the classic fairy tale.\n\nLike mother, like child. On the plus side, Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) provided a strong role-model for her reanimated son, Jason.\n\nBut perhaps it would have been better parenting to focus on teaching her kid to swim earlier in life, instead of schooling him in the proper art of bloody vengeance after he drowned at Camp Crystal Lake.\n\nIn what's sure to stir up a bit of controversy, we round out our list with Kate McCallister (Catherine O'Hara) from director Chris Columbus’ classic Christmas comedy.

        "instruction": "SOFIA, Bulgaria— Every day, large crowds gather outside the United States Embassy here to admire an exhibit on American space exploits. And senior Bulgarian officials, who willingly acknowledge their gratitude to the Soviet Union for helping to modernize their country's industry and agriculture, just as willingly express the strong desire for Western technology, particularly from the United States.\n\nIndeed, the overriding impression left by a recent tour of several Warsaw Pact nations is that, even though the days of political detente may be gone, Eastern Europeans still crave Western expertise and trade. The Jeans Cult\n\nA superficial indication of the taste for Western goods throughout Eastern Europe is the jeans cult. Practically every teen-ager here, as well as a good many of their elders, can be seen wearing jeans, often with popular American trademarks. In Prague, American-made jeans sell for more than $100 a pair on the black market.\n\nBut for trade of a more substantial kind, most Eastern European countries face one overriding obstacle: a shortage of hard currency. An additional restraint is the high cost of credit. And still another is the United States limitation on the sale of sophisticated technology or equipment that could have a military application.\n\nIncreasingly, Eastern Europeans are trying to solve these problems through what they call countertrade. Those Western companies that can accommodate buy-back arrangements or joint production in third countries are much in demand.\n\nIn addition, there are agreements for partial payment in goods rather than cash. If officials in Sofia, say, want a West German company to build a chemical plant in Bulgaria but do not have enough cash to pay for it, they might work out a deal to compensate the Germans in part with chemicals produced by the plant. Seeking Joint Ventures\n\nEven Bulgaria, which is dependent on Comecon, the Eastern European common market, for about 75 percent of its trade, recently passed a broad joint-venture law aimed essentially at attracting Western trade and technology.\n\n''Love is good, but it takes two partners,'' said Georgi Iovkov, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. Noting that progress in trade relations with the United States had been slow, he said, ''The limitations are yours, not ours.''\n\nThe Bulgarians' main complaint is that they, unlike the Hungarians and the Rumanians, do not have most-favored-nation status under American trade regulations. Nations assigned such status can benefit from trade and tax concessions. Some Success With Japanese\n\nAnd Bulgaria's Deputy Minister of Machine Building and Electronics, Todor Diulgerov, termed the American restrictions on strategic items ''a handicap for developing trade, but not development.''\n\n''Sooner or later we get the technology,'' Mr. Dikulgerov said, adding that the Japanese were ''more responsive'' than the Americans. One way Eastern Europeans are getting Western technology is through scientific exchanges. The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, for example, has invited American specialists in agricultural research, nuclear physics, metallurgy and mathematics. Also, Bulgarians have gone to the United States to study computer sciences and advanced farming techniques. Rumania\n\nRumania demonstrated its interest in Western trade by welcoming the establishment of a Manufacturers Trust branch bank in 1974. President Nicolae Ceau,sescu attended the opening. It is the only fully operational American bank in the Eastern bloc and handles operations in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Hungary as well.\n\nRumania, with its independent foreign policy, enjoys most-favorednation status, is a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and has a special agreement with the European Economic Community. Already, 52 percent of its trade is with the West and the developing countries.\n\nSuffering from foreign exchange shortages because of high oil prices, Rumania has developed a new investment policy that emphasizes arrangements that conserve its hard currency reserves, including countertrade and joint ventures. How Countertrade Works\n\nRumanians point to the General Electric Company as a model for countertrade arrangements.\n\nG.E. is providing the turbine generator for a Canadian-built nuclear plant, which is the first of 14 to be built in Rumania by the year 2000.\n\nTo satisfy the Rumanians' desire for countertrade, the company set up an International Trading Operations Department that will buy Rumanian products such as bearings, copper wire, metal products and steel plate, and that will market Rumanian cement and cloth abroad. Czechoslovakia\n\nCzechoslovakia also faces serious financial constraints, particularly in priority areas such as electronics, automobiles, engineering and metallurgy, chemicals and light industry.\n\n''We would gladly increase our trade with the United States,'' Rudolf Stolar, Deputy Director General of Trade Policy, said in a recent interview. He stressed that the lack of most-favored-nation status was the main obstacle in trade relations. The United States also made it difficult for Czechoslovakia to obtain new computers, process-control equipment, highly sophisticated measuring equipment and advanced electronics technology, he said. Hungary\n\nHungary has taken new steps to liberalize its economy with the establishment of a unified exchange rate for the forint, a major step toward the convertibility of its currency, scheduled for early next year. This should give a new lift to Western trade, now at more than 40 percent of the nation's total.\n\n''Doing business in Hungary is like working in the United States,'' an American entrepreneur, Carl Lambrecht Jr., said recently. He was referring to the easy, direct contact that is possible with Hungarian enterprises.\n\nMr. Lambrech has sold lasers and electro-optic equipment to the Hungarians, but complains that they bought electronic components from Japan because of United States export controls.\n\nThe 48-year-old Mr. Lambrecht, who is from Chicago, has been doing business in Eastern Europe for the past decade. He spends six months a year touring Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union for his company, CRL Inc. Problems With Bureaucracy\n\nIn a recent interview in Bucharest, Mr. Lambrecht complained particularly about the bureaucracy and protocol problems that confronted American businessmen in most areas of Eastern Europe. For example, he said, it often took a week to organize a visit to a factory.\n\n''Business isn't easy these days in the bloc because everybody has payments problems except the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Lambrecht said. (The Soviet economy, because of the country's extensive oil and gas reserves, has not been nearly as dependent on imports as those of its trading partners in Eastern Europe.)\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Lambrecht emphasized, the prospects for American business in Eastern Europe were good where countertrade could be arranged.\n\nThe biggest problem is getting export licenses from Washington because of a ''Don Quixote policy'' on items considered to be of a strategic nature, Mr. Lambrecht said. ''It's like doing business with the United States Post Office,'' he said. ''It has a monopoly for first-class mail but can't deliver. The clerks are honest, but there are so many regulations, effectiveness is reduced.''\n\n''Sometimes it takes months to get an export license in Washington that you can get in West Germany in a day.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Opec seminar in Vienna",

And senior Bulgarian officials, who willingly acknowledge their gratitude to the Soviet Union for helping to modernize their country's industry and agriculture, just as willingly express the strong desire for Western technology, particularly from the United States.   Indeed, the overriding impression left by a recent tour of several Warsaw Pact nations is that, even though the days of political detente may be gone, Eastern Europeans still crave Western expertise and trade. The Jeans Cult   A superficial indication of the taste for Western goods throughout Eastern Europe is the jeans cult. Practically every teen-ager here, as well as a good many of their elders, can be seen wearing jeans, often with popular American trademarks. In Prague, American-made jeans sell for more than $100 a pair on the black market."

        "instruction": "Did Serena Williams’ practice partner get “Quaided”?\n\nThe tennis world is talking about a series of Twitter posts by racqueteer Sascha Bajin in which he claims that married actor Dennis Quaid stole his date at a party thrown by Williams at her Los Angeles mansion.\n\nThe most humiliating part, according to the Twitter tale: Bajin claimed that he drove Quaid back to his hotel and watched as his date got out of the car and accompanied the “Playing the Field” actor inside.\n\nBajin, who is Williams’ longtime hitting partner, has since eliminated most of the tweets from his account, but they can still be found archived on the tennis news and social media website besabella.com.\n\nOne tweet that remains on Bajin’s Twitter feed was posted at 4:27 a.m. on Valentine’s Day. It suggests that something memorable occurred the night before.\n\n“God I wanna Tweet about what happened!! It’s killing me …” Bajin wrote.\n\nAccording to Williams’ Twitter account, the 13-time Grand Slam event champion hosted a karaoke party at her mansion that night. Her famous sister, Venus , was also at the soiree.\n\nBased on the eight tweets at besabella.com, Bajin and his date, who is not named, went to Williams’ party, then headed to a bar for a drink.\n\nThere they ran into Quaid and struck up a conversation with the actor, who reportedly has homes in his native Texas and in Montana.\n\nThe threesome decided to head back to the party, where Quaid seems to have convinced Bajin’s date that he wanted her as a doubles partner.\n\nIn a subsequent Tweet, Bajin wrote that he left the party with his date and Quaid and drove the actor back to his hotel.\n\nAfter pulling up to the entrance, Bajin claimed he watched the woman exit his car with the “Great Balls of Fire” star.\n\n“This chick has the nerve to get out and stay with him … Hahaha!!! All of that on Valentine’s Morning! Nice one, right?” he tweeted.\n\nSumming up the experience in a final tweet, Bajin wrote: “I simply got Quaided … Lol! He stole my date and made me drive him and her to his hotel.”\n\nBajin declined our repeated requests for comment.\n\nA rep for Quaid told us Bajin’s account “sounds like someone’s imagination is getting away from them. Dennis was with friends that night.” The spokesman added that Quaid is “still married\" to Austin, Tex., real estate agent\n\nThe couple wed in 2004 and are the parents of a twin son and daughter, 4.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2001, Quaid was married to Meg Ryan . In 2008, Ryan told Insight magazine that “Dennis was not faithful to me for a very long time, and that was very painful. I found out more about that after I was divorced.",

        "instruction": "Was P.G. Wodehouse, the popular novelist, musical comedy writer and humorist who created Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, the gentleman's gentleman, guilty of treason because of his wartime broadcasts from Berlin?\n\nEven if he was not a traitor, why weren't the details of his wartime behavior disclosed for his own and the public's sake? When the Queen knighted him in 1975, a few weeks before his death at the age of 93, did that act serve to acknowledge his innocence?\n\nThe answers to these questions are finally coming out as a result of the opening of documents that have been sealed under the Official Secrets Act in England as well as by an examination of Foreign Office and Gestapo records in Germany.\n\nThe facts appear in a work called ''Wodehouse at War,'' by Iain Sproat, a Conservative M.P. from Aberdeen, Scotland, who broke through the paper bureaucracy with such zeal that former Prime Minister Edward Heath nicknamed him ''Deep Sproat.'' It was published by Ticknor & Fields of New Haven and New York this week.\n\n''I may have been a fool but I was never a renegade,'' P(elham) G(renville) Wodehouse once explained to those who accused him of helping the Germans. Still, Mr. Wodehouse became an American citizen after the war, settling in Remsenburg, L.I., because he believed that he would not be welcome in England. Not Quite Exonerated\n\nMr. Sproat's study, while attempting to clear Wodehouse of actual treason, does not quite succeed in exonerating the humorist of what his countrymen, in wartime, believed to be foolishness to the point of criminal conduct that justified, at the least, a Governmental or judicial reprimand.\n\nThe accusations in the documents disclose that Mr. Wodehouse, who was living in France with his wife when the Germans made their lightning attack in 1940, did not attempt to escape from the advancing German Army; that he and his wife entertained Germans in their house at Le Touquet, and later in various private houses and hotels in France and Germany; that he was granted special privileges - such as the right to live in a hotel rather than in an internment camp, like other civilian refugees caught in the war -in return for broadcasting propaganda.\n\nThe most serious charges concerned the broadcasts themselves. Mr. Wodehouse made five talks from Berlin to reach Britain and the United States. The source for the official transcripts, reprinted in full in the book, is, curiously, the German Foreign Office.\n\nIn a display of vanity worthy of one of his Edwardian characters, the humorist said he believed that his readers were merely anxious to know his whereabouts, and that he was alive and well in German hands; it did not occur to him, he said, that he might be serving the enemy's propaganda machine by broadcasting. Never Advocated Enemy Cause\n\nIn the broadcasts - unlike those by William (Lord Haw-Haw) Joyce, the Briton who was executed after the war, and by Ezra Pound, the American poet who was declared unfit to plead charges of treason and was imprisoned in a hospital in Washington -Mr. Wodehouse never turned against his country or advocated the cause of the enemy.\n\nInstead, he tried to be funny, with such comments as: ''It has been in many ways quite an agreeable experience. There is a good deal to be said for internment. It keeps you out of saloons and gives you time to catch up on your reading.'' But his humor fell flat.\n\nBy the time of his fourth broadcast from Berlin, he had received criticism in the British press and felt a need to explain that he had been released from internment camp, like other civilians, because he was 60 years old, not because he had agreed to speak on the Berlin radio.\n\n''My reason for broadcasting was a simple one,'' he said. ''In the course of my internment, I received hundreds of letters of sympathy from American readers of my books, who were strangers to me, and I was naturally anxious to let them know how I had got on.'' 'I Regret It Sincerely'\n\nSo he told a Major E.J.P. Cussen, who in 1944 and 1945 interrogated him for M.I.5, the British military intelligence branch. Mr. Wodehouse had been allowed to live in the Hotel Bristol while the Germans occupied Paris. In the documents, his explanation became an apology:\n\n''I can now see that these broadcasts were an insane thing to do, and I regret it sincerely. My only excuse is that I was in an emotional frame of mind, and the desire to make some return for all these letters had become an obsession, causing me to overlook the enormity of my action.''\n\nThe author of ''Wodehouse at War'' reveals why the Wodehouse papers were closed and how he unlocked them: ''The British Government refused to make public the conclusions of the investigation by M.I.5 despite my repeated requests. I came to the conclusion that there was a department in Whitehall blocking my application. Then, I began to speculate that somebody else's name was mentioned in the Wodehouse file in a damaging context. I suggested that any such name be blanked out. They agreed to this simple solution.\n\n''When I obtained the papers, one name was blanked out. It was merely that of another British internee who had accompanied Wodehouse to Berlin. The British authorities had failed to establish the guilt or innocence of the other man, yet that one name apparently was the main reason why documents that could have cleared Wodehouse's reputation were kept secret. A generation of British politicians and civil servants took the easy way out and refused to divulge any information,'' he said.\n\nMr. Wodehouse's ''clearance'' of treason by M.I.5 was known, of course, inside the Government when the Queen conferred knighthood.",

        "instruction": "NEW YORK — While Apple was preparing a splashy introduction for a new service that would stream music over the Internet for a fee, the attorneys general of New York and Connecticut were quietly investigating the Silicon Valley giant’s negotiations with music companies in search of potential antitrust violations.\n\nThe attorneys general wanted to know whether Apple pressured the music labels — or whether the labels conspired with Apple and one another — to withdraw support for popular “freemium” services offered by companies like Spotify in favor of Apple’s paid music subscriptions.\n\nA freemium service typically starts free and is supported financially by advertising. Companies with freemium business models hope a free service is compelling enough to persuade consumers to pay for a more sophisticated offering — one typically free of ads.\n\nUniversal Music Group on Tuesday confirmed it was cooperating with the industrywide investigation, a continuing effort led by the attorney general of New York, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the attorney general of Connecticut, George Jepsen.\n\nThe first written response to the antitrust inquiry came from Universal Music Group a day earlier when the company’s legal firm, Hunton & Williams, sent a letter to the attorneys general. The letter said Universal Music Group has no agreements with Apple or music entities like Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group that would impede the availability of free or ad-supported services.\n\nThe music company added that it “shares the attorneys general’s commitment to a robust and competitive market for music streaming services in the mutual best interest of consumers, artists, services, and content companies alike — and we have a long track record to that effect.”\n\nA spokesman for Schneiderman said the attorney general was looking into Apple’s negotiations with music labels to preserve the benefits consumers have enjoyed from these new streaming services.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that the market continues to develop free from collusion and other anticompetitive practices,” said the spokesman, Matt Mittenthal.\n\nJepsen, the attorney general of Connecticut, said in a statement that his office was satisfied with Universal’s response, before adding, “We will continue to monitor that market to ensure that consumers and competition are protected.”\n\nThe European Commission is also looking into Apple’s negotiations with the music labels.\n\nThis is the second time both Schneiderman and Jepsen have pursued Apple on antitrust grounds.\n\nIn 2013, a federal judge said Apple violated antitrust law by colluding with book publishers to raise e-book prices above Amazon’s standard $9.99 pricing for digital books, after the publishers settled.\n\nThe attorneys general, who were both involved in the e-books price-fixing investigation, appear to be pre-emptively looking into the terms of Apple’s new music service for any signs of industry collusion before Apple Music is available to consumers at the end of this month.\n\nUnlike Spotify and other streaming music services, Apple does not offer a free version of Apple Music. But the company offers a three-month free trial period and says it will let artists and record companies make various kinds of content, including songs and videos, available for free on Connect, a promotional section of its service.\n\nThe so-called freemium model used by services like Spotify has been at issue over the last year.\n\nLast fall, the singer Taylor Swift removed her music from Spotify in a dispute over its free version, In recent months top executives at the major record labels have been sharply critical of free services, arguing that they do not generate enough money and they give consumers no incentive to pay for music.\n\nYet Spotify, which started in 2008, has been by far the fastest-growing subscription music service, with 60 million users, 15 million of whom pay. Last year, the company had $1.3 billion in revenue, and 91 percent of that money came from subscriptions. However, Spotify, which is privately held, also reported a net loss of $197 million.",

        "instruction": "CROTON-ON-HUDSON— From the personal files of the Van Cortlandt family, a recipe (pronounced re-CEEP in those days), dating from the late 1700's:\n\n''Mushroom Fricasie: stew them and pour away the liqueur -- fry them with a little butter and onion -- shred small some sweet majorum and thyme stript from the stalk. Season it with salt and pepper -- make a sauce of eggs, beat with the juice of orange, claret, the gravy of a legg of mutton and nutmeg -- shake them well -- give them a few tosses in the pan.''\n\nFrom the files of the company Country Cooking by Jan & Volker, a Croton-on-Hudson based catering concern that specializes in reproducing historic dishes: the exact recipe, along with others from ''The Art of Cooking Made Plain and Easy'' by Hannah Glasse, published in 1796, and ''A Complete Housewife or Accomplished Gentlewoman's Companion'' by Eliza Smith, published in London in 1729 and again in 1773.\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, Jan Lorenzen made the mushroom fricassee and salmagundi (a sort of chef salad), ragout of beef, butter chicken, vegetables the Dutch way, spinach pudding, lemon and orange cheesecakes (which contain no cheese but are custards) and almond macaroons, which bear no resemblance to today's macaroons but rather are meringues. The setting was the most appropriate possible: the 300-year-old Van Cortlandt Manor here, which was used by the politically and socially prominent Van Cortlandt family in the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The house, owned and operated by Historic Hudson Valley, is restored to reflect life in a wealthy Dutch-American home from the 1790's to 1815. The property includes the main house, where the Van Cortlandts lived, and the ferry house, leased by a middle-class businessman who ran the ferry across the Croton River and operated the building as a tavern. The bountiful dinner represented a cross-section of upper- and middle-class dishes and tastes.\n\nThe meal was served under a tent illuminated by candles and lanterns, with reproduction 1790's plates, glasses and utensils. Costumed staff members of Historic Hudson Valley described each course to the 50 diners, each of whom had paid $50, with proceeds marked for Historic Hudson Valley projects. A dozen or so dinners are put on at Van Cortlandt Manor each summer; this year's were sold out weeks ago.\n\n''The dinners are very popular,'' said the site director, Margaret Vetare. ''It is fascinating to study the foodways of a given society.'' The phrase, foodways, she added, has come into accepted usage by historians. ''What people ate, how they ate it, what their dining customs were, can tell us a lot about a society.'' In the late 1700's, Ms. Vetare said, formal dinners might include three courses, but each course consisted of six to eight different dishes. Eight various appetizers, eight entrees and eight desserts were set out on a buffet table and were served to guests, who were expected to take a bit of each offering. Middle-class dining was simpler, but basic cooking styles were the same. Lots of butter, fat and cream were used -- many guests at the dinner remarked how refreshing it was to get away from the late 20th-century obsession with light and diet foods. Nutmeg, cloves and mace were used more liberally than they are today, perhaps to conceal the strong taste of meat that was on the ripe side. Recipes were inexact, to say the least.\n\n''To make lemon cheesecakes,'' Eliza Smith instructs, ''Take two large lemons, grate off the peel of both, and squeeze out the juice of one; add to it half a pound of fine sugar, 12 yokes of eggs, egg whites well beaten, then melt a pound of butter in four or five spoonfuls of cream, then stir it altogether and set it over the fire, stirring it till it begins to be pretty thick, take it off and when it is cold fill your pattypans little more than half full.'' Ms. Lorenzan cooked almost all of the food on site, in the restoration's Dutch ovens, over burning embers. She worked on the banquet for two days; some of the recipes get quite complex. Spinach pudding, for example, not only requires chopping spinach, mixing it with butter, cream and spices but also shaping the mixture into balls, wrapping them in cloth and boiling them.\n\nNor were the food and beverages (soft and hard cider, lemonade, claret and Madeira) the only historically accurate aspects of the occasion. Felix Farrar played lilting fiddle tunes so the guests could do English country dances between courses; diners also played whist with reproduction cards and a board game called Nine Man's Morris, a cross between tick-tack-toe and checkers.\n\nBill Schroh, the site manager, and other staff members were clad in trousers and waistcoats, Empire-style dresses and caps. They passed out printed verses of house rules that might have appeared at the tavern in the late 1700's, as well as typical toasts. Each toast was made by a different guest: one, for instance, read, ''To Pierre Van Cortlandt, first Lieutenant Governor of our state, after 18 years in office, may he enjoy the comforts of the country life in his retirement.'' Among the rules for tavern behavior: ''Put not your meat to your mouth with your knife in your hand''; ''Neither spit forth the stones of any fruit pie upon a dish nor cast anything under the table'' and ''Kill no vermin -- fleas, lice, ticks, etcetera, in the sight of others. Put it off privately, and if it be upon your own clothes return thanks to him who puts it off.''\n\nAs for the guests, they not only obeyed the rules but they also oohed and ahed over the rich, tasty food and the unique ambiance. But virtually all of them agreed they would rather be living in the 20th century.\n\n''Things seemed simple then, but there were problems, too,'' said John Kelly, a firefighter from Queens who was there with his wife, Marianne, and their daughter Claire. ''We were told on the house tour that the second leading cause of death for women was cooking -- their clothes would catch fire frequently. Childbirth, I suppose, was probably the first.''\n\nDean Mayer of Chappaqua, who works for the County Office of Employment and Training, said: ''We like to think of life in the past as simple and lovely. We think times past were less stressful. But I'm sure there were many difficulties. Look at all the diseases they had no cure for.'' Mrs. Kelly added, ''Perhaps they had stronger family and community ties, but also there was not much mobility.''\n\nLydia Bryan, a teacher from Brooklyn, said: ''It was very isolated. There was very close community life, and people did a lot for each other, but it was also a closed society.'' She laughed. ''Certainly you couldn't send out for food if you didn't feel like cooking. Although I suppose 200 years from now, people will go to quaint restorations of fast-food franchises and eat Big Mac's and Carvel ice cream cones as part of historic dinners.''\n\nPhotos: At a reproduction dinner at Van Cortlandt Manor in Croton-on-Hudson, costumed staff serve the buffet meal, demonstrate dances on the lawn and a child wears a cap and dress of the period.

Stein, the incumbent.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Dinkins criticized as ''an inexcusable act of bad faith'' the hiring of 400 Transit Authority police officers with only 17 percent of them black or Hispanic recruits. He noted that the Guardians, an organization of black police officers, had charged in a Federal suit that the most recent transit police test was discriminatory and that the Transit Authority had gone ahead with the hiring while the suit was pending.\n\nSome candidates filed their post-primary financial reports yesterday with the Board of Elections. Among the more significant was Mr. Stein's report of $844,955 in expenditures - $420,000 of it loans - compared with $370,350 in expenditures by Mr. Dinkins, with $12,500 in unpaid loans. Mr. Stein defeated Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic primary by an unexpectedly close margin and the two are again opposing each other in the general election.\n\nIn another hotly contested primary, for the Democratic nomination for Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, who won, outspent Norman Rosen, but both candidates wound up with extensive outstanding loans. Miss Holtzman spent $336,319, of which $85,000 was in loans, while Mr. Rosen spent $262,335, including $155,000 in loans. Miss Holtzman still has nearly $100,000 in outstanding loans from her unsucccessful Senate campaign last year.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Mary T. Codd with Herman Badillo and Ismael Betancourt",

        "instruction": "PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 19— Princeton University officially opened a five-year campaign today to raise $275 million from its alumni. Unlike most fund drives, only a small amount of the money will be used for so-called ''brick and mortar'' projects.\n\n''This drive is necessary because there is simply no other way to sustain the quality of this place in the face of very difficult and demanding times,'' said the university president, William G. Bowen.\n\nThe largest share of the funds, $97 million, has been earmarked for faculty salaries, research projects and laboratories and $35 million will be set aside for undergraduate scholarships.\n\nPrinceton undergraduates get close to $9 million a year in scholarships, $1.6 million of which comes from Federal aid. The university here, which has 4,440 undergraduates, is the latest institution of higher education to initiate major fund-raising drives in recent years. In 1979, Yale University completed a $374 million campaign, raising $4 million more than it had projected. Harvard's $250 million drive began the same year and to date it has raised $186 million. This fall, Columbia plans to opened its drive, with the target tentatively expected to be $400 million.\n\nPrinceton officials estimate that the school will lose $600,000 in Federal aid to undergraduates during the next two years, and part of the fund drive is designed to fill in this gap. More than 40 percent of all undergraduates qualify for some form of financial aid. Students to Pay 14.7% More\n\nIn September, undergraduate tuition will go up by 14.7 percent to $8,380. At most private schools, the cost of educating a student is usually twice what the student pays. The slack is taken up for the most part by endowments and Government aid.\n\nMr. Bowen said the university, like other institutions, had been the victim of inflation and rising costs. ''There's a limit to what one can do with fees,'' he said. ''It's important that this place be open to candidates on the basis of their quality not their ability to pay.''\n\nThe fund drive has already received commitments of $63 million. The largest single gift to date in the campaign, $5.3 million, came from Gordon Y.S. Wu, a Hong Kong businessman who is a 1958 Princeton alumnus.\n\nThe call for funds has gone out to the university's 50,000 alumni, but most is expected to come in large gifts. Mr. Bowen said that ''we try to inculcate the notion of reaching as high as you can.''\n\n''It's not audacious at all,'' he said. ''Contributors get the satisfaction of being part of something that's bigger than any one of us.''\n\nIn addition to funds destined for academic programs and undergraduate scholarships, $47 million has been designated to maintain and expand library operations, $32 million to enlarge five undergraduate dormatories, $9 million for the university's athletic program and $55 million to augment the general operating budget. Endowment to Benefit\n\nA part of the money from each category will be used to increase Princeton's $906 million endowment. The university receives an 18 percent average return on its investments, but spends only 5 percent - $36 million this academic year -to support services. The remainder of the endowment income is reinvested. The fund drive is expected to increase the univeristy's endowment to more than $1 billion..\n\nPrinceton ranks fourth behind Harvard, the University of Texas and Yale in the size of its endowment. The university, founded in 1746, has 1,400 graduate students in three schools - architecture, engineering, and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International affairs. The Woodrow Wilson School received the largest gift in the university's history, $35 million in 1961 from the late financier Charles Robertson.\n\nIllustrations: photo of William G. Bowen",

        "instruction": "After a ho-hum performance for most of 2014, analysts believe that Japan's Nikkei 225 will see better days in the year ahead.\n\n\"Japan has been an 'ok' investment based on local currency, [but] 2015 will be better, especially after the recent elections,\" Peter Boardman, managing director at Tradewinds, told CNBC. Shinzo Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition won snap elections by a landslide on December 14, maintaining a 'supermajority' in the lower house.\n\nThe Nikkei has risen 5.4 percent year to date, which pales in comparison to its 57 percent surge in 2013. The bulk of the gains came after the Bank of Japan shocked markets in late October by increasing its already massive asset-buying program; the market gained 15 percent since then as the yen tumbled 10 percent against the U.S. dollar.\n\nRead MoreJapan 4Q manufacturing sentiment worsens: Tankan\n\nThe central bank's move came as the economy tipped into a technical recession, putting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's growth-revival plan, dubbed Abenomics, into question.\n\nHowever, the Nikkei has seen steep falls since December 9 as a collapse in oil prices wreaks havoc on global markets. On Wednesday, it traded at 16,819.73, down 1,000 points over the course of seven sessions, before rebounding 2.3 percent on Thursday.\n\nPolicy, yen to drive market\n\nPro-growth policy activism and a weak yen will lead the market higher in the near term, analysts say. Throw in the mix a 10 trillion yen tax break, thanks to lower energy prices, and Japanese equities are set for a leg up in 2015, noted Tradewinds' Boardman.\n\n\"Deflation is over in Japan. If the yen stays low, foreign companies may return to take advantage of lower production costs. Together with government efforts' to lower taxes and stimulate the economy, 2015 makes for a pretty good year,\" he added. Boardman favors large exporters like Toyota Motor and casualty firms like Mitsui Sumimoto.\n\nRead MoreJapan firmspromise Abe 'utmost efforts' to lift wages\n\nNomura expects the Nikkei to hit the 18,000-20,000 range, while the Topix will rise to 1,575 by end-2015. Market-positive factors include increased purchases of Japanese shares by the government's public pension fund and stronger-than-expected corporate earnings as a result of cheaper oil, weaker domestic currency and improving corporate governance.\n\n\"At the corporate level, companies are showing a clear pattern of improving profitability against the anaemic macroeconomic backdrop, as they pay more attention to controlling costs while reaping the benefits of a weaker yen,\" analysts wrote in a report.\n\nAn upward trend in real wages resulting from Abe's decision to postpone a second tax hike to 10 percent, initially scheduled for October 2015, also augurs well for consumer spending, which makes up 60 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, and in turn the stock market, Nomura added.",

        "instruction": "BOSTON, March 17— A new blood-filtering process for diabetics whose kidneys have failed may be cheaper, faster and more effective than ordinary dialysis, according to a team of Canadian doctors.\n\nThe new method is also more convenient.\n\nIt uses a patient's internal membranes to screen impurities from the blood without requiring him to travel several times a week to a dialysis center. The patient has a catheter installed in his abdomen and attaches it to a plastic bag that is worn externally.\n\nThe researchers who helped develop the treatment, which is called continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, say it is far more effective than standard hemodialysis for diabetics. Hemodialysis is a time-consuming process in which a machine filters out blood impurities. Some Risk of Infection\n\nIn peritoneal dialysis, blood is purified by the peritoneum, a membrane lining the abdomen. One danger of the treatment is the risk of developing an infection called peritonitis. The Canadian doctors found that patients developed the infection, on average, once every 21 months.\n\nIn the issue of The New England Journal of Medicine to be published Thursday, the researchers said the method might become ''the treatment of choice'' for diabetics who need dialysis.\n\nAbout a quarter of the more than 47,000 Americans who depend on dialysis because of kidney failure are diabetics. Most of these patients rely on hemodialysis.\n\nDr. Dimitrios Oreopoulos of Toronto Western Hospital, who directed the study, said that nondiabetics who are doing well with hemodialysis should not switch to the new method until doctors have more experience with it.\n\nHowever, many diabetics do poorly with hemodialysis. In one study, only 34 percent survived three years of treatment. In the Canadian study, doctors put 20 diabetics with kidney failure on peritoneal dialysis. After two years, 81 percent were still alive. All lived nearly normal lives.",

        "instruction": "FOR those who live in the city but enjoy a campfire in the chill of winter, there are a number of places in the metropolitan area that sell everything from firewood to Irish peat to warm the hearth. As prices vary, care and patience will help in finding the bargains.\n\nFor practical purposes, firewood is generally sold in bags or bundles of 10 to 12 split pieces, or ''splits.'' Splits often come in two sizes, 16 or 24 inches long, to accommodate the different sizes of stoves and fireplaces. For those with bigger needs, cords of wood are available at several locations. A cord of wood measures 128 cubic feet and has about the same heat-producing power as 200 gallons of heating oil. But its size usually makes it an impractical choice for apartment dwellers - it requires the same amount of space as a grand piano.\n\nKindling is an assortment of twigs, scraps or chips of wood used to start the fire. Softwoods such as pine, fir and hemlock are best because they are easy to start and burn quickly. Kindling is commonly sold in burlap sacks, about the size of a bag of onions.\n\nStorage can be a problem. Bundles are small and can be kept near the fireplace or on a shelf. The wood could be stowed on the floor of a closet, but remember that wood is not normally clean and is often the habitat of small insects that thrive on warmth.\n\nAt most places, delivery is free, but it is important to check whether this means street or apartment delivery. To carry wood up to an apartment, woodsellers usually charge a small amount for each floor they must travel.\n\nThe best wood for the body of a fire is seasoned hardwood, which has generally been cut, stacked and left standing in a dry place for 10 to 12 months. Dry wood is best because it leaves less soot in the chimney and produces more heat than green, or recently cut, wood. Hardwoods, including ash, maple, oak, white birch and elm, are best because their density makes for a longer fire and a good bed of coals.\n\nFor those who have never used their fireplace, it is advisable to ask the landlord or building supervisor when the chimney was last swept. A clean chimney is essential to a good fire and should be checked every two to three years. It is also important to make sure the fireplace damper is open and that there is proper ventilation to avoid filling the room with smoke.\n\nWood-burning stoves and fireplaces produce creosote, a natural byproduct of burning wood that leaves a deposit in chimneys and can block them over a period of time. A very hot fire can ignite the buildup and possibly set the house afire by eating into the rafters, walls and studs. Chimney cleaning concerns are listed in the yellow pages.\n\nMost wood sellers agree that the best way to build a fire is to form a small pyramid. Crinkled newspaper should be put at the base, followed by a few chips or sticks of kindling. Three logs should then be stacked on the andirons, placed toward the rear of the fireplace.\n\nFor a change of atmosphere, fruit and aromatic woods such as wild cherry, hickory and apple are available at several local distributors. Aromatics are denser than average hardwoods and burn for a longer time. But their chief advantage is that they give off a pleasant scent that lingers for hours.\n\nCannel coal is a tough, lusterless bituminous coal that is well suited for the fireplace. Easy to start, it burns with a bright flame and produces good heat for a period of hours.\n\nDuraflame and Presto logs are compressed and chemically treated sawdust logs available in supermarkets and hardware stores. Prepackaged and easy to start, they will burn for three or more hours but produce less heat than real wood. They should be used sparingly, for they give off smoke that tends to leave residue in the chimney.\n\nAnother alternative to wood is Irish peat, a form of compressed plant matter from bogs that is sold in dried blocks. It gives off a definite odor and good heat, although not as much as cannel coal.\n\nThe following is a selection of sources that sell fuel for the fireplace or stove: Manhattan A.A. Armator & Son, 1701 Second Avenue, at 88th Street; 737-1742.\n\nA bundle of approximately 10 to 12 pieces of quarter-cut wood, 12 or 16 inches long, $6; 24-inch is $8.

On Tuesday, Getty Oil, Marathon Oil and Superior Oil were standouts, with gains of 5 1/8, 4 and 3 points, respectively, in a largely lackluster stock market. Moreover, Superior Oil's 500,000-share turnover was second only to Conoco's 1.2 million shares.\n\nYesterday, Getty and Marathon experienced profit-taking, with Getty closing at 77 3/8, down 1 1/4. Marathon dropped 1 3/4 to 74 3/4, partly in reaction to a reduced earnings estimate for the current year. Superior remained strong, closing up 3 1/8 at 47 1/2.\n\nSome traders appear to be guessing that losing bidders in the Conoco campaign will chose new targets and major ones at that. Getty, a fully integrated company, is somewhat smaller than Conoco, with revenues in 1980 of $10 billion, compared with Conoco's $18 billion. Marathon is also fully integrated, with 1980 revenues of $8 billion. Much smaller Superior, an exploration and production company, had sales of $1.5 billion in 1980.\n\nCities Service, with nearly $8 billion in revenues in 1980, has been active and strong on takeover rumors as well. The shares closed yesterday at 57 1/2, up 1 1/4.\n\nThe company said last week that it was not a merger candidate, but some in Wall Street believe would-be purchasers might not agree with Cities' self-serving assessment.\n\nCities Service attained unwanted publicity when it stepped out of the picture as Seagram, Du Pont and Mobil pursued Conoco. Cities and Conoco had announced earlier that they had engaged in merger discussions, and Cities' withdrawal prompted a Wall Street wag to call the company, ''The Yellow Knight.''\n\nIt may well be that one or more of the second-tier companies will become takeover targets. Wall Street analysts don't necessarily expect this, however.\n\nAs for Superior, an oil analyst who asked not to be identified doubts a takeover attempt. He notes that the Keck family, its foundation and Superior insiders own a commanding 35 percent of the common stock.\n\nHe and other analysts believe the shares are active and strong as a result of rumors that the company will liquidate. But even that prospect is regarded as remote.\n\nWhat analysts think more likely is that Superior will join a trend by aggressive exploration and development companies to streamline operations. Companies are doing this through a technique designed to reduce taxes to holders of a part of the company's properties.\n\nThat is, by spinning off income-producing assets to an independent trust, several oil companies have moved to eliminate taxes on those properties at the corporate level.\n\nThe spinoff in turn shrinks the asset base. This is desirable because the smaller the base to which newly discovered reserves are added, the more successful the company appears to be. The more successful the perception of a company in Wall Street, the higher the shares are likely to trade -or so the reasoning goes.\n\nThe analyst mentioned earlier thinks that Superior Oil may be contemplating such a trust for some properties and that the story may have gotten around instead that Superior is liquidating.\n\nMesa Petroleum started the trust movement in 1979 when that exploration and development company set up the independent Royalty Trust.\n\nIn 1980, Southland Royalty followed with a spinoff of two such entities, the San Juan Basin Trust comprising properties in New Mexico and the Permian Basin Trust with West Texas properties.\n\nLast April, when Tenneco took over Houston Oil and Gas, it followed form with a Houston Oil Trust spinoff made up of assets accounting for 75 percent of Houston's domestic income. The trust shares were distributed to former Houston Oil holders.\n\nSince the properties in the trust are no longer part of the corporation, the income they produce is not subject to corporate taxes. Trusts that distribute virtually all of their income to shareholders do not pay taxes at the trust level. Thus, the trust device has - or at least appears to have - eliminated what is referred to in investor circles as the double tax on dividends.\n\nThe hope is that the Internal Revenue Service will go along with these trusts and not treat the device as a sham to avoid taxes. None of the trusts so far have received rulings from the Internal Revenue Service forgiving the tax at the corporate level, though the companies clearly expect favorable rulings.\n\nIt might be noted that President Reagan's omnibus tax bill contains the most liberal changes since business taxes became an important revenue source. Obviously, those who favor the trust device are counting on a compliant I.R.S. not to rule that the trusts are devices to avoid taxes.\n\nBut trust speculation may not be the reason for Superior's strength. About a year ago Superior announced a discovery in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea oil fields. Only recently, the Norwegian Government estimated that the field could contain three billion barrels of recoverable oil. The gas find was estimated at over 40 trillion cubic feet.",

If you ring my doorbell at 8 a.m., I’m going to look like this!’\n\n“I asked, ‘What if I rang at five to 8?’ And she said, ‘Then I won’t answer it!’\n\nAs it turns out, Parton’s penchant for all things blond, old and beautiful (at all hours of the day) fits nicely with her character in “Noise.”\n\nIn the film, opening Friday, she plays larger-than-life G.G. Sparrow, a fiery spirit who butts heads with fellow small-town Georgia gal Vi Rose Hill (Latifah).\n\nThe two dig into each other as they jostle for control of their church choir while struggling to keep Vi’s daughter Olivia (Keke Palmer) away from G.G.’s rebellious grandson (Jeremy Jordan).\n\nThey may bicker onscreen, but offscreen, Tennessee-bred Parton, 65, and Jersey girl Latifah, 41, tend to finish each other’s sentences, and both let it be known that their mutual admiration started well before they sang their first harmony for Graff’s film.\n\n“We talked on the phone about two or three times before we actually met,” Parton says in that familiar twang. “Then, when we finally met, all day long I was putting on different outfits and combing my hair out. I couldn’t wait to see her!\n\n“I was so nervous, it was almost like we were going on a date or something.”\n\nAdds Latifah, “I still sometimes have to stop and pinch myself and say, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s Dolly Parton!’ ” They each, of course, started in music — country-and-Western and rap — before moving to acting. They said their decision to tackle the inspirational tale stemmed from a desire to fuse their love of music and movies.\n\n“When I’m acting, I can just throw on a record, put a song on my iPod and it takes me [to where the character should be],” Latifah says. “I don’t have to go into ‘Who died in my family,’ or ‘Will I ever have children?’ I can just go with the chords alone and I’m there.”\n\nMusic is a big part of their movies, anyway. From Parton’s “9 to 5” and “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” to Latifah’s “Chicago” and “Hairspray,” they’ve blended their passions well.\n\nAnd “Noise” adds another note — though the founder of the Dollywood theme park, a performer since the age of 9, says she prefers the short form to the long haul of making movies.\n\n“I prefer my music,” Parton says. “I’m more of a one-nighter person than a squat-down-for-three-months kind of gal. But [making a film], you have to kind of brace yourself for that.”",

        "instruction": "By any measure, literary or otherwise, Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is an extraordinary work.\n\nThe 1960 novel won the Pulitzer Prize, has been ranked second in influence only to the Bible, sold 40 million copies worldwide and inspired a movie that notched three Oscars two years later. And in the six decades since, it has served as a moral beacon to generations of Americans confronting the evils of our national scourge — racism.\n\nThe reclusive author's own story, however, is as gripping as the saga in the pages of her legendary first novel.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: ACTRESS WHO PLAYED SCOUT REMEMBERS HARPER LEE\n\nHow improbable is it that in the tucked-away town of Monroeville, Ala., Lee's playmate next door was Truman Capote?\n\nAs a child, Capote was sent to live with his aunts for a few years after his parents' divorce. and somehow the friendship persisted even as a cocksure Capote laid early claim to literary fame in Manhattan.\n\nLee, who died Friday at the age of 89, was known, made the move herself in 1949, known at the time as Nelle. But she would struggle for years before finally submitting a manuscript in 1957. It proved more of an incomplete draft — though it was published last year, under the title \"Go Set a Watchman,\" causing a great disturbance among her longtime fans.\n\nBy chance, her editor at the now-defunct J.P. Lippincott was the sublimely-gifted Tay Hohoff. She saw something in the scatter of anecdotes and worked closely with Lee in bringing \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" to the page.\n\n'TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD' AUTHOR DEAD AT 89\n\nHow closely? It can only be said that the transformation of the awkward and sometimes shrill \"Got Set a Watchman\" into the nationally treasured \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is still a marvel.\n\nBoth books use an incident from Lee's life as plot point. Her father, a lawyer named Amasa Coleman Lee, once defended two black men accused of murdering a white storekeeper. The men were ultimately found guilty and hanged.\n\nIn \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" six-year-old Scout is a close observer as her father, Atticus Finch, heroically defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Gregory Peck, in a white suit, brilliantly personified Finch's nobility in the 1962 movie.\n\nIn \"Go Set a Watchman,\" a 26-year-old Scout returns to her small Southern town appalled to find her father, Atticus, is a bigot and an adamant segregationist.\n\nThe latter novel was published amid great controversy when Lee's lawyer, Tonja B. Carter, claimed to have discovered the manuscript in a drawer. She and representatives from the publishing house, HarperCollins, said Lee, then confined to a nursing home, had given them consent to publish.\n\nWhether or not the origin story is true, \"Watchman\" is a painful book both in terms of the writing and its changed perspective of Finch. The two portrayals of the character are pieces that could not be made to fit in the same puzzle.\n\nMany longtime fans felt betrayed.\n\nEDITORIAL: MAKER OF A MASTERPIECE\n\nThroughout her life, Lee was famously known as a recluse who never wrote another novel. It's true, after some initial interviews, she refused to sit with any reporters, whether they came at her with a pen or a microphone. But she was not a hermit — she just chose her company selectively.\n\nLee was by Capote's side in Holcomb, Kan., as he researched \"In Cold Blood.\" She wouldn't join his dinner table, though, as he fawned over his coterie of Manhattan socialites and chatted up the literati.\n\nEventually she returned to Monroeville to live in the family home with her older sister, Alice, a lawyer and Nelle's gatekeeper until her death in 2014.\n\nLee, though, spent part of every year in Manhattan enjoying a social life. She was not at all averse to meeting new people as long as they came to her through old friends.\n\nBut it is a shame that, in the wake of \"Watchman,\" Lee leaves a diminished legacy. She deserved a better ending to her story.",

        "instruction": "ROME, May 23— Italy's Justice Minister, Adolfo Sarti, resigned today following reports linking him to a powerful, secret Masonic lodge that has been implicated in a variety of criminal activities.\n\nThe growing scandal surrounding the lodge has shaken the coalition Government of Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani and has dwarfed all other scandals that Italy has endured in the last 30 years.\n\nThe scandal, which had been simmering for months, broke open Thursday when Mr. Forlani, on the advice of investigating magistrates in Milan, made public a list of 953 names of reported members of the lodge, called Propaganda Due, or P-2. The list included Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament, judges, army and police generals, bankers, journalists and other figures in the Italian Establishment.\n\nMr. Sarti, a Christian Democrat, denied having been a member of the lodge, but documents found in the offices and country villa of Licio Gelli, the lodge's grandmaster, reportedly show that he applied for membership.\n\nYesterday Mr. Gelli, who is in hiding, apparently abroad, was indicted in absentia on charges of spying for Argentina. He is understood to hold Argentine as well as Italian nationality.\n\nCol. Antonio Viezzer, a member of the lodge and former head of SID, a now dissolved government intelligence organization, was arrested yesterday on the same charges placed against Mr. Gelli.\n\nThe Forlani Government and the major political parties have not yet decided what sanctions, if any, they will take against military and civilian officials belonging to the lodge, whose members, according to the police, had sworn ultimate allegiance to their grandmaster rather than to the nation.\n\nIn a report to the Government, the Milan magistrates wrote that ''Gelli had constructed a very real state within the state,'' using blackmail, favors, promises of advancement and bribes.\n\n''Lodge P-2 is a secret sect that has combined business and politics with the intention of destroying the constitutional order of the country and of transforming the parliamentary system into a presidential system,'' the magistrates said.\n\n''Gelli's strategy has been to bring under his control a large number of powerful and highly placed persons and thus to break down, for the first time in Italian history, the separation between political, administrative, military and economic spheres,'' they said. Powerful Banker Arrested\n\nOne of Italy's most powerful bankers, Roberto Calvi, a member of the lodge and longtime friend of Mr. Gelli, was arrested Wednesday on charges of having used his banks for illegally exporting huge sums of money and of having been involved, with Mr. Gelli, in the fake kidnapping of Michele Sindona, the bankrupt financier who sought to avoid trial in New York by fleeing to Europe.\n\nMr. Calvi is president of Banco Ambrosiano and of La Centrale Finanziaria, a financial institution. Six members of the board of La Centrale were arrested at the same time, among them Carlo Bonomi, the head of the Invest Financial Company, one of the four largest groups of its kind in the country.\n\nThe arrest of Mr. Calvi and his associates ''decapitated'' the financial Establishment of Milan, a journalist said. Mr. Calvi's La Centrale had recently bought more than 40 percent of the Rizzoli publishing group, which owns Corriere della Sera, a leading newspaper. Corriere Editor Denies Report\n\nThe name of Franco Di Bella, editor in chief of Corriere, was on the list of reported members of the lodge. Mr. Di Bella, in a meeting with the paper's news staff, denied that he was a member but said Mr. Gelli, the lodge grandmaster, had approached him on several occasions and had once asked him to dismiss one of the paper's leading writers. Mr. Di Bella said he had rejected the suggestion.\n\nMr. Calvi's involvement in the Sindona affair and in allegedly illegal money transfers came to light in documents seized by the police in Mr. Gelli's house in Arezzo, Tuscany, last March, according to police reports.\n\nThis in turn led to the resignation of Ugo Zilletti as acting head of the Supreme Council of Magistrates, which is responsible for appointments, promotions and transfers of judges, prosecutors and other legal officers. Mr. Zilletti resigned in the wake of allegations that he improperly helped Mr. Calvi get back his passport after it had been confiscated by the investigating magistrates. Jailed General on List\n\nAmong the generals whose name appeared on the list of reported members of the lodge is Raffaele Giudice, the former commander of the Finance Guard, the paramilitary force specializing in border control and antismuggling operations. General Giudice is in jail in connection with a huge petroleum tax scandal that came to light last fall, when it was discovered that more than $2 billion from Italian tax revenues had been diverted into private pockets and spirited aborad.\n\nAlso on the list are about 20 officers of the Carabinieri, the prestigious paramilitary police corps. Gen. Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, one of the ranking Carabinieri officers, was listed as a candidate for membership who had not been admitted. He has been quoted as telling investigators that he applied for membership in the hope of finding out if any of his men were in the lodge.\n\nGen. Giovanni Grassini, the chief of Sisde, the secret intellegence and security service of the Interior Ministry, and Gen. Giuseppe Santovito, the head of Sisme, the security unit of the Defense Ministry, were also on the list.\n\nLabor Minister Franco Foschi, a Christian Democrat, and Foreign Trade Minister Enrico Manca were listed as members but have denied that they had joined. 50 Deny Being Members\n\nMore than 50 others - including Pietro Longo, the Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, several journalists and members of Parliament - denied being members of the lodge, although their names were on Mr. Gelli's lists.\n\nMr. Gelli, an industrialist, joined a Masonic lodge in 1963 in Frosinone south of Rome and a short time later organized Lodge P-2, apparently as an elite organization intended to reach much deeper into the Italian Establishment than any of the other lodges.\n\nItaly has about 550 Masonic lodges. Membership is estimated at 15,000, including many Roman Catholics. But Flaminio Piccoli, the Secretary of the church-connected Christian Democratic Party, said a few days ago that membership in a Masonic lodge was incompatible with being a Christian Democrat because ''the Masons are a force that attacks the church.''",

Both of them were warm-hearted kids, easy prey for the bait that Commies dangle before confused liberals. ... Each of them was trapped because he thought with his heart.\"\n\nTheir careers had been remarkably similar. Both were tough city kids, Lionel Canegata, a West Indian from Manhattan's San Juan Hill, Julius Garfinkle, a Jew from the lower East Side waterfront; both were promising amateur boxers in their youths; both found their callings in the theater, and both were reared and nurtured in the federal companies of the Depression-stricken 1930s.\n\nBoth became stars of stage and screen. Both were pointedly political, actively lending their names to progressive causes and choosing productions that reflected their views. Both were caught up in the Reds-in-Hollywood investigations, and both suffered professional damage. Both, indeed, had appeared in the 1947 film \"Body and Soul,\" a politically charged lightning rod for the period's anti-Red crusaders.\n\nNow it was May 1952, and both were relatively young men yet - Canada Lee 45, John Garfield 39 - and both were dead.\n\nThey thought with their hearts, Ed Sullivan wrote. As Oscar Hammerstein had put it in \"The King and I,\" Sullivan noted: \"The heart is not always wise.\"\n\nCANADA LEE'S passing drew quietly respectful obituaries. The one-time star of \"Native Son\" had worked mostly in Europe of late, his widely publicized associations with Paul Robeson and Howard Fast and other leading leftists having cost him a good many U.S. roles. A few months earlier, his powerful performance in Zoltan Korda's British film \"Cry, the Beloved Country\" had won him accolades anew; he was soon to go to Italy to appear in a Technicolor \"Othello.\"\n\nBut his health was failing. Bedridden with uremic poisoning at his home on W. Fourth St., he lapsed into a coma and, on Friday night the 9th of May, suffered a fatal heart attack. The obits noted that Canada Lee had once said of himself that all his life he had been \"on the verge of becoming something.\"\n\nIT WAS A heart attack that killed John Garfield as well, 12 days later, but Garfield went out in a blaze of lurid headlines befitting a major Hollywood leading man, the darkly brooding star of \"They Made Me a Criminal\" and \"The Sea Wolf\" and \"Destination Tokyo\" and \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" and \"Body and Soul\" and \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and \"Force of Evil.\" He hadn't made a picture in more than a year, but he was still hot copy.\n\nHe had more or less self-destructed in April 1951, when, appearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, he swore that he had never met a Communist and that indeed he had never known until 1947 or thereabouts that Reds were active in Hollywood.\n\n\"Impossible,\" snorted Sullivan, noting Garfield's long friendship with leftie playwright Clifford Odets, his mentor since the federal theater days. Other observers considered Garfield's testimony to be naÂve at best, and the FBI, amid much fanfare, put him under investigation for perjury.\n\nNo more films came his way. In the spring of 1952, he was appearing in a seven-week revival of Odets' \"Golden Boy\" at the American National Theatre and Academy on W. 52nd St. This was the play that had made him a Broadway star in 1937, but this time the reviews were lukewarm, and his best prospect for the future was a minor production set to open in Miami Beach in June. Now, in early May, he sought to atone. On the advice of his lawyers, he went to the FBI.\n\nCertainly he had known Reds for years, he admitted; certainly he had belonged to Red-front groups; certainly he had attached his name to dozens of statements. \"Actors are emotional,\" the papers quoted him. \"The Commies would come to us and say, 'Sign here, everybody's doing it for civil liberties.' So I would sign.\" He was set to speak out further. He was going to name names, of top film colony figures, of agents and publicists, of State Department officials, of Soviet diplomats.\n\nInstead, on Tuesday night the 20th, he visited a sometime actress named Iris Whitney at her Gramercy Park West apartment, complained of not feeling well and went to sleep. The next morning, Whitney found him dead. Apparently frazzled by the thought of publicity, she refused to let cops in, holding them at bay until they finally broke down the door with a tire iron.\n\nIRONICALLY ENOUGH, Sullivan wrote, it was the boxing picture \"Body and Soul\" that probably had caused Garfield's death: During one of the more physically demanding ring scenes, he had torn a heart muscle, and he had never fully recovered.\n\nThat movie's writer and director had subsequently refused to testify before HUAC, and by now both were blacklisted. \"As a case history,\" Sullivan wrote, the film \"is of tremendous importance to Americans fighting Communism because it illustrates the manner in which Commies and pinks, in the field of communications and ideas, give employment to each other. ...\n\n\"Up to just before his death, when he attempted to come clean, Garfield had twisted and turned in a vain attempt to escape responsibility for his stupidity. ... 'Body and Soul' should open the eyes of those confused liberals who have assailed the House committee as witch hunters.\"",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 27— The Reagan Administration is planning to expand significantly the production of plutonium for a buildup in the United States' arsenal of nuclear weapons, according to Reagan Administration and Congressional officials.\n\nF. Charles Gilbert, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Materials, said in an interview that a 15-year plan for warhead production would require a substantial expansion of the nation's capacity to produce plutonium and tritium, two of the critical materials used in making atomic weapons. The plan is to be submitted soon to President Reagan, who is expected to approve it.\n\nThe expansion is a result of the Administration's reported decision to build an estimated 17,000 nuclear warheads over the next several years to supplement and replace the current stockpile of an estimated 25,000 weapons. The estimate is based on calculations using information from the Defense Department's budget and programs.\n\nOne Government official familiar with the weapons projection described as ''within the ballpark'' the accuracy of the estimates, which have been made by the Arms Control Association, a private Washington-based group that favors arms control, and others, although the Pentagon itself does not publish figures on warhead production and stockpiles.\n\nLast fall the National Resources Defense Council, a Washingtonbased environmental group that opposes the development of nuclear weapons, said that the stockpile would be expanded over the next decade by about 14,000 weapons, which did not take into account subsequent requests for weapons.\n\nThe expansion in warhead production, the largest in 20 years, would provide warheads for a new generation of weapons being developed by the military, including the MX intercontinental missile, a new submarine-launched Trident missile and hundreds of cruise missiles.\n\nMr. Gilbert said that if the new plutonium production goals were approved by Mr. Reagan, as expected, the Energy Department would require a budget supplement for the fiscal year 1983 of ''several hundred million dollars'' in addition to the $1.04 billion the Administration has already requested for weapons material production. The $1.04 billion request is $170 million higher than last year's materials production budget of $904.4 million.\n\nMr. Gilbert outlined several of the alternatives being weighed by his agency for increasing plutonium stocks, two of which were listed, but not financed, in the budget for 1983 that was unveiled last month.\n\nHowever, he said that the Administration ''would not require'' and ''has no intention of using'' fuel from commercial reactors in the weapons program.\n\nThe proposal to recycle commercial fuel for use in atomic weapons, which had been championed by the Energy Department, had stirred strong opposition in Congress. Critics there have argued that it would blur the customary distinction between military and civilian use of nuclear fuel and undermine the nation's nonproliferation objectives.\n\nThe Senate last year approved a measure to prohibit the use of spent fuel from civilian nuclear power plants for making military weapons. But the provision, which had been sponsored by Senator Gary Hart, Democrat of Colorado, was deleted in November in a House-Senate legislative conference. However, the conferees said in their report that they supported continued separation of the military and civilian nuclear programs, and Senator Hart plans to reintroduce the measure next month.\n\nMr. Gilbert said the department was reviewing several ways of expanding plutonium supplies by building new production facilities or increasing production at existing reactors. One way to accomplish the latter, he said, would be to change the design of reactors at the department's aging Savannah River production facility in South Carolina to provide for more efficient loading of the reactor cores. 'Substantial Undertaking'\n\nMr. Gilbert acknowledged, however, that this method was ''a substantial undertaking'' that would require an increase of ''several hundred million dollars'' over the requested financing levels.\n\nHe said the agency was also considering ways of increasing plutonium production at reactor at Hanford, Wash., known as the N reactor.. This could be done by increasing the levels of power at which the reactor operates or by blending an increased amount of very pure plutonium with lower-grade plutonium made for the fast breeder reactor program.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Gilbert said the agency was exploring the acceleration of a program designed to use lasers to separate plutonium from nuclear fuel. But he stressed that this controversial technique, if accelerated, would not be used to separate plutonium from commercial reactor fuel, only from military supplies.\n\nFinally, Mr. Gilbert said that a new $5 billion production reactor would probably be needed. However, he denied a report that Energy Secretary James B. Edwards had already promised Senator James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho, the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, that the new reactor would be in his home state.\n\nThe measures Mr. Gilbert outlined go beyond those he described in Senate testimony last fall, most of which were initiated by President Carter and have already been financed by Congress.\n\nThe Government, for example, is modernizing the Savannah River site, and one reactor there, closed since 1968, is being restarted, at a total cost of about $600 million over six years. In addition, a reactor at Hanford now making fuel-grade plutonium is being converted, at a cost of $160 million, to produce material for weapons. Some fuel is already being blended, and research on separation with lasers is well under way.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Gilbert said that what he called the ''ingoing numbers,'' those contained in the new planning document, would require even more plutonium for warheads than the increase planned in a previous stockpile memorandum signed by President Carter in October 1980.\n\nPentagon officials noted that it was Mr. Carter who began the substantial buildup in military forces that has required increased plutonium and tritium supplies. President Reagan, the officials said, was merely continuing and accelerating that trend.\n\nPlutonium is used either in fission weapons or as a trigger in thermonuclear weapons. Tritium is used as the fusion material in a thermonuclear weapon.\n\nThe amounts of plutonium and tritium needed for planned and stockpiled weapons are secret. But officials familiar with the new planning document said that the new production goals would approximately double the rate of plutonium produced in the Carter Administration.\n\nThomas B. Cochran, a staff scientist with the National Resources Defense Council, a Washington-based environmental group, criticized the way in which stockpile memoranda and plutonium requirements in general were estimated.\n\n''There ought to be a public assessment of and debate about the need for new weapons materials,'' he said. ''The armed forces hands in a weapons wish list and the Department of Energy simply estimates how much nuclear material will be needed for these arms.''",

        "instruction": "THE new $80 million arena in the Sports Complex in the Hackensack Meadowlands, delayed by labor problems and difficulties in obtaining building materials, is near completion and will be opened on June 19.\n\nStill to be finished, according to Michael J. Breslin, a member of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates the complex, is a walkway over Route 20. The walkway, to cost $1.1 million, is being constructed so that 4,000 motorists can park in the lot at Giants Stadium when they attend events at the arena.\n\nThe new facility, which is named for Governor Byrne, can seat at least 20,000 for basketball games - the Nets already have signed to use the arena as their home site - but there is not enough parking space adjacent to the building. Thus, the authority has made arrangements to use a parking lot across the road.\n\nIn addition to the walkway, Mr. Breslin said, a $600,000 scoreboard is being installed, presumably in time for the opening. Mr. Breslin, who said that 250 events would have to be staged in the arena each year if it was to meet its operating and debt expenses, indicated that the authority was trying to schedule prizefights and other sports attractions. He reported that the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus had agreed to appear there for a month and that Bruce Springsteen, the rock star, would perform for a week.\n\nNoting that ice-making apparatus already has been installed, Mr. Breslin said that the authority was ''making every effort'' to sign a professional hockey team to use the arena as its home. He reported that several ice shows already were booked for this year.\n\nThe authority, Mr. Breslin said, is aiming to have many music programs during the year, since the arena can accommodate all types of productions acoustically. The New Jersey Symphony, if its contract and other problems are ever resolved, is scheduled to perform, he said.\n\nThe right-turn-on-red law for motorists, adopted in New Jersey more than five years ago, is not working out quite as expected, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe law, the institute says, ''was intended to conserve fuel, but to do so consistent with safety.'' The regulation, a study found, saves fuel - between 0.2 and 1.3 gallons a year - and three to 17 seconds a day for the average motorist.\n\nBut is it consistent with safety? No, says the institute. Among the findings was that at intersections where right-turn-on-red is allowed there were 20,000 more accidents than before. Among those involved were 1,400 more pedestrians than anticipated, most of them children and older residents.\n\nThe United States Department of the Interior, having completed a series of public hearings on proposals to transform the Delaware Water Gap into a national recreation area, has reduced the scope of its plan.\n\nAlbert Hawkins, superintendent of the area for the National Park Service, which will oversee development of the proposals, said that it had been decided to make revisions that were ''reasonably feasible of implementation'' in this decade. Special attention, he said, will be given to the ''solution of problems that are more immediate.''\n\nAs it stands, the Park Service will work on resource protection, visitor use, facility development and management of the property, rather than enlargement. It was thought that the Delaware Water Gap could have been incorporated into the National Wildlife and Scenic River Act program, which was approved 10 years ago.\n\nHowever, the public hearings raised the issue of what could be done about those who lived on land that had been, or would be, acquired by the Park Service for any expansion plan. Officials agreed that the evictions should be avoided, and many persons objected to the possibility that housing for Park Service employees might take priority.\n\nThe Department of the Interior reported that there were a large number of requests for increased availability of sports facilities, such as sites for camping, canoeing and hang-gliding. In addition, there was concern that any greater development would upset wildlife habitat and survival.\n\nWith commercial theft increasing in the New York-New Jersey area, the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers-Newark is in the midst of a Federal study to find the causes for these crimes.\n\nWorking under an 18-month grant of $442,587 from the National Institute of Justice, the Rutgers group, headed by Prof. Richard F. Sparks, is focusing on large-scale burglaries at warehouses, seaports, factories and airports, all of which have been widely publicized recently. The group has established a research center that will work with similar facilities across the country on major aspects of crime.\n\nThe Rutgers project, which deals primarily with stealing, includes interviews with convicted thieves in prisons in the metropolitan area and the study of police records. The overall program is sponsored by the United States Department of Justice.\n\nMoney from the $475 million Transportation Bond Issue approved by New Jersey voters in 1975 is being earmarked for improvements in highways, public transit and bridges, according to Louis J. Gambaccini, the state's Commissioner of Transportation.\n\nIn a special report to the Legislature, Mr. Gambaccini said that $97.8 million already had been committed to more than 300 projects and that the program was ahead of schedule in state aid to localities.\n\n''We are digging into the backlogs in all transportation areas and moving these bond funds as quickly as possible,'' he said. ''In addition to meeting needs earlier, we are trying to minimize the impact of extraordinary inflation in construction costs.''\n\nIn his 53-page report, Mr. Gambaccini noted that contracts for 271 buses had been awarded to Grumman Flxible, which is expected to make delivery beginning in June. Grumman has had problems with cities across the country, including New York, because of structural flaws in the undercarriages of its buses.\n\nAnother important development, Mr. Gambaccini said, was that plans for reconstruction of the Newark subway system had been completed. He said that contract bidding should start in August, with a goal of October, 1983 for finishing the work.\n\nAs for railroad equipment, he reported that 58 coaches had been ordered, 55 of them for the Raritan Valley Line. Delivery is expected by the end of 1982.\n\nFunds from the bond issue also have been allocated for improvements at the railroad stations in Newark, Iselin (Metropark) and Trenton. Most of the alterations are scheduled in areas that offer commuter services.\n\nNoting that $115 million in matching Federal funds had been raised because of the assignment of work from the bond issue, Mr. Gambaccini said that most of the state money - $44.3 million - had been committed to public transit projects. He also said that there had been $450 million in applications from counties and municipalities for state aid on projects and that this was far above what had been allocated for the purpose.\n\nIllustrations: photo of sports arena in Hackensack Meadowlands",

        "instruction": "A year ago, before the first published reports of a Federal investigation of point-shaving at Boston College, Lou Carnesecca convened the annual meeting of his St. John's basketball team at which an F.B.I. agent lectures about the dangers posed by gamblers.\n\nThe agent talked to them about the college basketball scandals of the early 1950's and 1960's - before most of them were born - and pointed out that even the participants in fixed games can rarely detect that the score is being held down to help the gamblers beat the point spread.\n\n''Would you believe that you may have been involved in a case of it right on this court?'' the agent asked the players in reference to one of the Boston College games then under investigation. The players stared at him in disbelief.\n\nSince then, Rick Kuhn, a former Boston College player, and four other men have been convicted of sports bribery and racketeering and face prison terms.\n\nAs a result, when Carnesecca convened the team meeting last week, the subject of point-shaving and associating with gamblers had a special immediacy and the players listened attentively.\n\nThe issue is a continuing crusade for Carnesecca, who remembers the scandals of 20 and 30 years ago as well as he remembers the score of his most recent game.\n\nAs the coach of a team in the New York area, where temptations are thought to be greater, Carnesecca says he feels the danger of his athletes succumbing is real and constant. For the last five years, he has invited an F.B.I. agent to help educate the St. John's players and has required each of them to sign a statement promising to report any attempted bribes.\n\n''You fellas are always asking me why I bring these people in to talk to you,'' Carnesecca said last week. ''The answer is, because it's there. I hear you say, 'Coach, we've heard this so many times.' We have it so many times because we care for you. The school will go on. Basketball will go on. But the stigma will be attached to you forever. Our advice to you is: Watch the company you keep, watch the guys who are overly nice to you, be careful of your associations.''\n\nThe pledge signed by St. John's players obligates them to report any suspected bribes, but Carnesecca recognizes that peer pressure might make a player reluctant to report a shady suggestion from a teammate and fear of physical harm might make him reluctant to report an offer from a gambler. Carnesecca also recognizes that for some players the offer of significant sums of money to control the outcome of a game might be too tempting to refuse.\n\n''We could have Our Lord himself come in here and talk,'' Carnesecca said, ''and unfortunately some fellas, in a moment of weakness, will succumb. There are some kids who by nature can't do anything right. There are some poor kids, or rich kids, who need money because of their habits, who -if somebody puts it on the table - are going to take it.\n\n''Still, we have an obligation to make them aware that there are people out there looking to use them to make a buck. We have an obligation to make them aware of the grave consequences and the grave stigma to themselves, their family and their friends. They are in danger of shutting off the incredible niceties that will be available to them in the future and finally of living with that chain around their necks for the rest of their lives.'' World of Difference\n\nLloyd Free, a free-spirited and high-scoring guard for the Golden State Warriors, is rarely known as Lloyd to his teammates, the fans or the news media. With his approval, he has been known best as World, in much the same way that Julius Erving has been Doctor J and Sylvester Williams has been Sly.\n\nNow it is official. In legal matters, and also by preference, the 28-year-old, 6-foot-2-inch super-leaper shall be known henceforth as World B. Free. Last week, he received official notification from authorities in Brooklyn, where he grew up and went to Canarsie High School, that his request to change his name had been approved.\n\n''From now on, if they call me Lloyd when they're introducing me, I'm not coming out,'' he said. ''When I hear World Free, then I'll make my entrance.''\n\nHow did he get the nickname World? ''It was in the ninth grade,'' he said. ''Everybody had a nickname in the ghetto. Some guy named Herb Smith laid World on me and it stuck forever after.''\n\nFree says the new name reflects the change in his play under Al Attles, the Golden State coach. Previously, Free had been a highscoring player for Philadelphia and San Diego of the National Basketball Association, averaging as many as 30.2 points a game one season.\n\n''I like playing for him,'' Free said of Attles. ''He lets us freewheel a lot, but we can run our plays if the time comes for it. As usual, I'm leading the team in scoring. But I'm also leading in assists. That's kind of strange, isn't it? But it's helped us to a winning record, and now we're in second place in the Pacific Division, behind the Lakers.\n\n''We say that Al's system is called 'All the Freedom in the World.' ''I'm moving up in the world,'' he said. ''So I thought I better do something to commemorate it. I was thinking for a long time of making my nickname official, so this season I finally decided to do it.",

        "output": "A year ago, before the first published reports of a Federal investigation of point-shaving at Boston College, Lou Carnesecca convened the annual meeting of his St. John's basketball team at which an F.B.I. agent lectures about the dangers posed by gamblers.   The agent talked to them about the college basketball scandals of the early 1950's and 1960's - before most of them were born - and pointed out that even the participants in fixed games can rarely detect that the score is being held down to help the gamblers beat the point spread.   ''Would you believe that you may have been involved in a case of it right on this court?'' the agent asked the players in reference to one of the Boston College games then under investigation. The players stared at him in disbelief.   Since then, Rick Kuhn, a former Boston College player, and four other men have been convicted of sports bribery and racketeering and face prison terms."

He had completed most of the fiscal 1983 budget to be presented to Congress late in January or early in February. Mr. Reagan will return here Sunday.\n\nThe President, speaking briefly to reporters aboard Air Force One, was asked if the budget decisions were made. He said, ''We're pretty much solid on that.''\n\nHis helicopter touched down in Los Angeles at a high school near the hotel where the Reagans will be staying. To Work on Speech to Congress\n\nLarry Speakes, the deputy White House press secretary, told reporters that the President plans to work on his first State of the Union Message, which probably will be delivered to Congress Jan. 26.\n\nThe President also took 36 bills with him. Mr. Speakes said that the bills may be signed Tuesday. They include military and foreign aid appropriations, a measure preserving the Social Security minimum benefit and changes in programs for coal-miner victims of black lung disease.\n\nOn his sixth California vacation, Mr. Reagan is to dine with Michael, his son by a first marriage, and the Reagans' daughter, Patti. They also will see friends in Beverly Hills, Calif., and attend a New Year's Eve party at the Palm Springs estate of Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher. Security Briefings Planned\n\nEach day, the President will receive national security briefings sent by cable from the White House. In addition, there ''may be a couple of meetings,'' Mr. Speakes said, in the Century Plaza Hotel, according to a White House official who asked not to be identified.\n\nHe said that he was asked not to discuss details of the trip, as a security precaution imposed because of reports of a team of assassins from Libya sent to kill Mr. Reagan and other American officials.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Reagan told reporters, he will fly by helicopter to his ranch near Santa Barbara. 'Annual' Golf Game Planned\n\nIn his Palm Springs agenda, Mr. Reagan said, ''I'll have my annual golf game.'' A scaled-down staff accompanied the President. Making the trip were Michael Deaver, the deputy chief of staff; Joseph W. Canzeri, who handles Presidential schedules and travel, and Mr. Speakes.\n\nBut Mr. Deaver, one of the three top aides, planned to spend part of the week elsewhere in California. Mr. Reagan's previous trips to California as President were in February, May, June, August, when he spent most of a month there, and over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nIllustrations: photo of President and Mrs. Reagan",

Those hushed sanctums, once reserved for scholarly pursuits, now quake with rock music or vibrate gently to the sound of chamber ensembles. Modern-dance troupes vie with budding baritones, poets, celebrity lecturers and theatrical productions for bookings. Walls are laden with revolving exhibitions of frequently traditional, but occasionally avant-garde, painting and photography.\n\nAs a result, ''people are in the library who never would have come before,'' said a staff member in New Rochelle. There, former patrons of facilities in Larchmont and Scarsdale are coming to the new downtown New Rochelle facility. In Yonkers, ''We have standing-roomonly for black history and concerts,'' according to a spokesman.\n\nIn packed auditoriums around the county, film devotees are engrossed in vintage John Ford, contemporary Lina Wertmuller or offbeat originals by local filmmakers. The very fact that art galleries, workshop space, storage for movies, recordings and pictures, auditoriums, lecture and meeting rooms have become an integral part of new library construction and old library modernization is testimony to the changes that have taken place.\n\nThe newest development is in video-lending services. ''We have just mailed back our opinion in a survey conducted by the central library system regarding the future acquisition and lending of video cassette tapes,'' said Eugene Mittelgluck, director of the New Rochelle Library. ''We're in favor of it.'' So were more than a dozen other directors contacted.\n\nFinding explanations for the phenomenon was not difficult. ''Libraries have traditionally been places where the cultural history is appropriate,'' said Mike Steinfeld, director at Mount Kisco. ''As libraries have spread farther from the urban center to accommodate people who have moved, it was expected that we would provide these things. Especially when there is no other place. It interfaces well with the type of book and general information we already have.''\n\nWestchester libraries are not as advanced as the venerable New York City libraries, where a strong emphasis on cultural programming has prevailed for decades, and the scale of operations is much grander than it is in the suburbs.\n\n''There is nothing new about this with us,'' said Edwin Holmgren, director of the New York Public Library Branches. ''We have perhaps the largest collection of videotape in the world in the film and video center of the Donnell Branch on 53d Street,'' he added, ''and we have had a computer-produced card catalogue for 10 years. The expense of such an operation is not feasible for the numbers of people using it in an individual suburban library,'' he speculated, although computerized card catalogs are being considered at the Greenwich Library in Connecticut, where a second addition since 1968 is under construction and will focus on extensive video services, films, records and lending art.\n\nAmong suburban libraries, none approaches the diversity and qualiity of Greenwich's, a facility cited by more than one Westchester librarian as ''the best and most active in the region,'' founded in a 60-year-old tradition of cultural involvement and aided by generous contributions for special arts programs from the Friends of the Greenwich Library. An annual infusion of about $17,000 by the Friends is a marked advantage over the average $3,000 to $4,000 supplied by similar groups to Westchester libraries.\n\nBut Westchester is coming along. Faced with serving a public as heterogeneous as that of New York City, constrained by an economy that faltered just as the libraries got going and bucking stiff competition for philanthropic dollars, county libraries nonetheless have been aggressive in producing new programs and recasting themselves in a more lively image.\n\n''It's difficult to get money from corporations because the Council for the Arts in Westchester has declared itself to be the conduit for corporate funds,'' said Judith Conway, director of the Warner Library in Tarrytown. A total of 38 Westchester libraries operate independently within their communities, financed by local government and aided by private and corporate contributions.\n\nIn Chappaqua, Ann Kiewel, director of art exhibitions, said, ''We incorporated programs based on what we felt was an increasing need in the community for a place to go for culture, what with fuel prices and the hassle of getting into the city.''\n\nBecause such a large proportion of Westchester audiences are former New Yorkers, many first-rate artists and musicians view suburban libraries as Broadway producers once viewed the Shubert Theater in New Haven.\n\n''We're the dress rehearsal for the Tokyo String Quartet spring tour,'' said Mary Brown, director of the Rye Library. ''They've come back each year for seven years.''\n\nThe Rye Library has spun off the New England Brass Ensemble and the New York Renaissance Band, according to Mrs. Brown, and the effect of such programming is undeniable. ''Ten years ago, we had 300 people attending 30 events, last year, we had 9,000 people attending 350 events,'' she said.",

The latest data represented a significant disappointment, as economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting an increase of 0.8 percent.\n\nThe production data followed an Economy Ministry report Friday that showed a 2.2 percent decline in German factory orders in October from September, more than twice market expectations.\n\nWith the biggest economy in Europe, Germany has been the locomotive of the 17-nation eurozone, and signs of weakness there could bode poorly for its neighbors and the millions of unemployed people across the Continent.\n\nThe euro bloc, still under pressure from the sovereign debt crisis and the austerity measures adopted for addressing it, grew just 0.1 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months, with Germany growing a larger, but still anemic 0.3 percent.\n\nThe poor economy and signs that deflation was becoming a danger led the European Central Bank in November to cut its main interest rate to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent.\n\nThose factors have also prompted the bank to consider new monetary policy measures, including so-called quantitative easing or negative deposit rates, bank officials have said recently.\n\nThe data Monday suggested that Germany’s “main growth engine has not only stalled, but gone into reverse,” Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics in London, said in a report.\n\nLoynes noted that German industrial output had fallen for three of the last four months for which data were available and was off by 1.4 percent in the four months since June.\n\nMonday’s report was at odds with other more recent indications of strength, however, and the Economy Ministry played down the September-October contraction. The government noted that the slowdown had followed a strong summer, when output increased at a 0.7 percent quarterly rate amid pent-up demand.\n\n“The manufacturing sector is likely to expand its production in the coming months,” the ministry said in its statement.",

Patrick Roy conversed with his posts.\n\nIn the 21st century, one particular superstition is blatant: the playoff beard. In the postseason, especially in baseball and hockey, the art of not shaving is part of the modern culture. A lack of facial hair is a playoff surprise.\n\nLuckily, the modern era also provides specialists to help analyze such men. Dr. Allan Peterkin is pognologist (beard scholar), who has written three best-selling books on facial hair. He has been published in the New York Times, The New Yorker, Sports Illustrated, The Wall Street Journal, Men's Halth, GQ and Esquire.\n\n\"Men bond around facial hair,\" Peterkin says. \"It's one of the few things guys can do that women can't.\"\n\nSome credit the New York Islanders dynasty of the 1980s as being pioneers of the playoff beard. Peterkin says there is good reason why this macho superstition has spread.\n\n\"The idea of a playoff beard, which has extended beyond hockey to other sports, is that you're in this together,\" Peterkin says. \"You're manifesting your loyalty to your team. It's a real kind of bonding team experience. It's very masculine.\"\n\nIn 2013, the Boston Red Sox provided notable images with beards that drooped a few inches under chins. Mike Napoli, Jonny Gomes, David Ross and Jared Saltalamacchia took the playoff beard to the next level. Of course, Fenway Park bullpen police officer Steve Horgan had his facial hair eternalized with a bobblehead.\n\nThe Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants are not doing too shabby themselves this fall. The Giants had practice two years ago, and for some players, two years before that (There is no Brian Wilson in San Francisco anymore, but Sergio Romo, the closer in the 2012 World Series as well, has done well as a beard replacement).\n\nIn the Bronx, the New York Yankees have a history, spearheaded by the late George Steinbrenner, of disallowing players to grow facial hair. Peterkin notes the Yankees are the final remains of a previous error in sports that held athletes to different appearance standards.\n\n\"You had to sport an All-American look of healthy rosy red cheeks and stuff like that,\" Peterkin says. \"Facial hair was thought of as kind of dark. Now, it's opened up. The athletes say they're not corporate slaves. They're free to express themselves.\"\n\nHypothetically speaking, when ThePostGame asked Peterkin if he would grow hair as a member of the Yankees, he chuckled and considered such a situation.\n\n\"I like the freedom,\" he says. \"I think most guys like the freedom to go back and forth and do what they want. I guess it would depend on what the salary was.\"\n\nOutside of sports, Peterkin, a spokesman for Dove Men+Care Face Range, is currently advocating five notable forms of fall facial hairstyle. The \"Stubble\" is the trendy, youthful look. The \"Mustache\" shows a loyalty to facial hair history. The \"Full Groomed Beard\" shows facial hair confidence. The \"Wild and Untamed,\" displays a lack of care and can be considered the \"playing hard to get\" of beards. Meanwhile, clean-shaven is not a poor choice of facial hair. It is clean and Peterkin says, \"you don't have to break rules to make your point.\"\n\nPeterkin was a judge at the 2012 National Beard and Mustache Championships in Las Vegas. He resides in Toronto, where he is an associate professor of psychiatry and family medicine at University of Toronto.\n\n-- Follow Jeffrey Eisenband on Twitter @JeffEisenband.\n\nLike us on facebook, follow us on twitter, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nNBA Hall Of Famers With Titles For Two Teams\n\nNBA Hall Of Famers With Titles For Two Teams\n\nKareem's first title came with Milwaukee in 1971 as he and Oscar Robertson guided the Bucks to the only championship in franchise history.\n\nAfter being traded to the Lakers, Kareem collected titles in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988.\n\nIn 1966-67, Chamberlain averaged 24.1 points and 24.2 rebounds to lead the 76ers to a 68-13 regular-season record and the NBA championship.\n\nAfter being traded to the Lakers, Wilt lost his first two Finals appearance, to Celtics in 1969 and the Knicks in 1970. But in 1972, Chamberlain and Lakers capped a season that included a 33-game winning streak and a 69-12 record by wiping out the Knicks in the Finals.\n\nWilkes won NBA rookie of the year in 1975 when he and Rick Barry helped the Warriors win the title, sweeping the Bullets in the Finals.\n\nWilkes then became the part of three title teams with the Lakers in 1980, 1982 and 1985.\n\nWalton was the catalyst to Portland's 1977 NBA championship team. In the clinching Game 6 against the 76ers, Walton had 20 points, 23 rebounds, 7 assists and 8 blocks.\n\nInjuries derailed his career, but Walton earned the NBA's Sixth Man Award in 1986 in helping the Celtics win the third and final championship of the Larry Bird era.\n\nJohnson was NBA Finals MVP in 1979 when the Seattle SuperSonics won the only championship in franchise history.\n\nThe Celtics acquired Johnson to help contain 76ers guard Andrew Toney, who had earned the nickname The Boston Strangler.

The stepson, Alexey Semyonov, who is Miss Bonner's son by a former marriage, emigrated to the United States four years ago and lives in Newton, Mass.\n\nMiss Alekseyeva indicated that the letter from Gorky, where Dr. Sakharov was banished in early 1980 because of his dissident activities, had been sent through friends and not by mail.\n\nThe letter, written by Dr. Sakharov and by his wife, Yelena G. Bonner, appeared to support the contention of the Sakharovs' friends that the removal of the couple to a hospital, announced on Friday, was not voluntary.\n\nThe portion of the letter written by Dr. Sakharov was emphatic that neither he nor his wife would change their mind about the fast they started Nov. 22 until the authorities approved Miss Alekseyeva's departure. The letter said Dr. Sakharov lost 18 pounds and Miss Bonner 14 pounds in the first nine days of the fast. Right of Emigration Is Defended\n\nThe letter demanded democratic freedoms for Soviet citizens, including the right to emigrate; it said that his death and that of his wife from the hunger strike would amount to ''murder'' accomplished by the K.G.B., the internal security police, and it denounced the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which has ignored appeals from Dr. Sakharov, a member, for help.\n\nDr. Sakharov opened the letter, dated Dec. 2, by thanking Sidney D. Drell, a Stanford University physicist, for a message of support. ''We were touched by your efforts,'' Dr. Sakharov said. ''We know that our friends and our family suffer because of us, but we have no choice. We are not seeking suicide. Any tragic outcome would only be a murder accomplished with the connivance of the K.G.B. and the compliant silence of my colleagues in the Academy of Sciences.\n\n''We are continuing our hunger strike here on the 10th day. It is not just a defense of the right to love and life of our loved ones (a subject on which our appeals to fellow scientists and others in the Government have produced no response), it is a fight for the right of everyone to come and go from his country freely.''\n\nIn a note of her own, Miss Bonner hinted at the discomfort the couple were feeling by saying that, with the 10th day of the fast, they were expecting things to get ''easier,'' in accordance with the pattern for starvation that the couple had found described in medical texts.\n\nMiss Alekseyeva, who filed her latest request for a visa on Nov. 12, may hear a decision tomorrow.

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, April 12— The Environmental Protection Agency said today that an estimated 10,000 hazardous waste facilities would be required to get liability insurance covering property damage and injuries resulting from chemical accidents.\n\nThe agency, reversing a preliminary decision made last fall, said that facilities would have 90 days to get $1 million in liability insurance for such sudden accidents as explosions. Insurance will also be required for what the agency termed ''non-sudden accidental occurrences,'' or leaks of toxic chemicals that could slowly poison people living nearby. But those regulations will be introduced over a three-year period.\n\nSimilar insurance regulations were pending last year, but the agency said in October that it was planning to withdraw them. The announcement met a storm of protest.\n\n''We felt it was a state issue,'' Rita Lavelle, an Assistant Administrator of the agency, said today. ''But, frankly, the testimony came in otherwise.''\n\nShe said public comment on the subject had been nearly unanimous in favor of requiring insurance for hazardous waste sites. Rules Were Strongly Supported\n\nAnne M. Gorsuch, the agency's administrator, said in a written statement that the insurance requirements ''have been asked for by state agencies, the regulated industry and the general public.''\n\nUnder the rules, to be published in the Federal Register this week, liability coverage for sudden accidents will have to be in place by mid-July.\n\nThe minimum coverage will be $1 million per accident and $2 million per year. Large companies could satisfy the requirement by showing they have financial assets sufficient to meet claims, including at least $10 million in net worth.\n\nSlow leaking of chemicals from landfills and other disposal sites that could poison water supplies would have to be covered by insurance of at least $3 million per incident or $6 million annually.\n\nCompanies doing more than $10 million in business annually would be required to have that insurance by next January. Concerns with $5 million to $10 million of business a year must have coverage by January 1984, and smaller operators must have the coverage by January 1985.\n\nJohn Skinner, director of state programs in the Environmental Protection Agency's solid waste office, said that 39 insurance companies now offered coverage for hazards relating to chemical wastes and that disposal companies should have no trouble getting coverage.",

Schwartz is known for specializing in the marketing of healthcare clients and technology firms.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed yesterday. Schwartz reported $25.2 million in fee billings last year.\n\nBryan Scanlon, president of Schwartz, and Ari Milstein, its chief operating officer and chief financial officer, will run Schwartz MSL\n\nScanlon said the company, which has US offices in San Francisco and Waltham, has been expanding its global footprint in recent years with outposts in London and Stockholm.\n\n“We really wanted to go global,’’ said Scanlon. “With the acquisition, we are instantly global.’’\n\nCompany officials said they are not planning any layoffs but are likely to hire as they prepare to move into a 30,000 square-foot office in Waltham in November. The company was founded in 1990 by Steve and Paula Mae Schwartz, a husband-and-wife team.\n\nThe acquisition is the second one for Publicis in Massachusetts. In 2007, the French firm bought Digitas Inc., a Boston agency focused on digital marketing, for $1.3 billion. Schwartz executives said they expect more collaboration between the two firms.\n\nJim Tsokanos, president of MSLGROUP Americas, said Publicis Groupe bought Schwartz because of its expertise in the healthcare and technology areas.\n\n“We believe that the Schwartz MSL perspective allows us to be a trusted adviser to our clients in those categories,’’ said Tsokanos, who added that the promotion of emerging technology “is part of the DNA of every client whether its packaged goods, automotive, or banking/financial services.’’\n\nGeoff Klapisch, an advertising professor at Boston University, said that Publicis Group’s purchase of Schwartz makes sense as it looks to extend its reach into the healthcare and high-tech sectors.\n\n“It helps complement their client base,’’ said Klapisch .\n\nSchwartz’s clients include the medical device company Accuray , E Ink Corp., and Kiva Systems, a maker of robots for distribution centers. For years, Schwartz has been publicizing E Ink, the Cambridge company that makes the electronic display screens that look like ink on paper and are used in e-readers such as Amazon’s Kindle device.\n\nSchwartz joins a growing list of Massachusetts advertising and marketing firms that have been scooped up by out-of-state firms.\n\nHavas, a Paris global advertising holding company, bought Arnold Worldwide in 2000.\n\nInterpublic Group of Cos. , based in New York. also owns Hill Holliday and Mullen, two of the biggest ad agencies in Boston.",

        "instruction": "A talking tennis ball, a singing monkey, and a couple of dummies with attitude are just a few of the characters who will take the stage of the Company Theatre in Norwell for two shows Saturday. They come to life through the startlingly skillful voice of ventriloquist Jay Johnson in his Tony Award-winning show, “The Two and Only.”\n\nJohnson has been throwing his voice through dummies — or “wooden Americans,” as he likes to call them — since he was a boy. He broke into mainstream culture with his hilarious roles as the shy, sweet Chuck and his obnoxious dummy, Bob, on the 1970s sitcom “Soap.” Throughout the ’80s and ’90s he was a frequent TV show guest star and staple on the comedy club circuit. In 2006 he came to the American Repertory Theater with “The Two and Only,” a show that transformed his club act into a moving story of his passion for his craft. “The Two and Only,” which features eight puppets and three disembodied voices, plus Johnson, went on to win a special Tony Award in 2007.\n\nJohnson spoke by phone from his home in California about the show and his art.\n\nQ. It’s been a while since “The Two and Only” played on Broadway. Did you take a break?\n\nA. I’ve been taking the show around to different places. I don’t have a set tour schedule. If I’m doing 20 performances, I want to do more. If I’m doing 50, I want to do less. Performers are never satisfied. It’s about the flow and the journey. I did spend some time finding the perfect theater to tape a live performance of the show, and that should be released later this year.\n\nQ. Has the show changed since Broadway?\n\nA. Not really. When we were in Cambridge at the American Repertory Theater, we were still making changes, adding and subtracting things that worked and didn’t, but by the time we got to Broadway the show was set.\n\nQ. How is “The Two and Only” different from an act you’d perform in a comedy club?\n\nA. I have a lot of characters I’ve developed over the years; they’re “club characters,” with seven minutes of material. We call them “Tonight Show” chunks. (See www.monkeyjoke.com for Johnson and his puppet Darwin’s side-splitting appearance on “Late Show With David Letterman.”) But “The Two and Only” is the story of my journey with my instrument over the years, from discovering the fun of throwing my voice and making people laugh, to meeting my idol and mentor Arthur Sieving, who built my first professional puppet for me, to being cast on the TV show. It has a dramatic arc and allows for a range of emotions, particularly around my relationship with Art. But I’m careful not to make it too syrupy. That’s every performer’s tightrope. If it feels real to me, I hope it feels real to the audience.\n\nThis is not a concert with a ventriloquist playing a lot of characters. All of the characters fit together in one story.\n\nQ. How many puppets appear in “The Two and Only”?\n\nA. There are eight physical puppets and three disembodied voices. Since I’m telling my personal story of my journey with ventriloquism, I had to focus on the ones who contributed to that. I include Squeaky, the dummy Arthur Sieving made for me, particularly the scene in which I tell him I got the part on the TV show, but he did not. The TV show writer wanted someone a little edgier, with a more modern look, so I introduced Bob and put Squeaky on the shelf.\n\nI also include Spaulding, a tennis ball, which was just a toy I had when I was a kid, with a mouth I could move. When we were developing “The Two and Only,” we thought this would be a great place to put the character and allow me to pretend to be a kid again, but the question was, how would Spaulding appear? The ball, of course, just rolls onto the stage.\n\nQ. Some people find the idea of a talking dummy a little creepy. Does that bother you?\n\nA. Every writer creates back stories for their characters, and the most believable characters are those that have unique personality quirks. Maybe it’s a little creepy for some people because it’s a puppet speaking and I’m right next to him. I do find my characters change as time goes on. Bob and I talk about different things now than we used to. I don’t know if it’s a schizophrenic split in my mind or if it’s similar to a musician and the way they play their instrument on a particular piece of music.\n\nWhen I was still developing the show, the director from “Soap” came to see it and talked me into including Squeaky and the moment when I tell him he didn’t get cast in the TV show. At first I thought it was ridiculous. To me, Squeaky and Bob are the same character in a different dress, but when I started thinking about the scene, their personality quirks made them react very differently. For me, that was the moment when the instrument played itself.\n\nQ. In the midst of so much virtual entertainment, do you see this art form as old school?\n\nA. I think kids relate to this because it’s a story they can follow, and a piece of it revolves around my relationship with Art Sieving. That relationship starts with my phone call to him when I was a teenager, and one of my directors said we should end the show with a kid calling me.\n\nI don’t think we’ll ever see the popularity of a “Howdy Doody” show again, but I think fads change. Jeff Dunham is doing very well.\n\nI think of myself as a vaudevillian, which is an old-fashioned name, but it really means I perform on stage. I am proudest of the Tony Award because it’s for live performing. You have to earn it on stage eight days a week.",

Inside are five pages of the two teaming up and even a fist-bump between Spidey and the new president.\n\n\"It was a natural after we learned the new president is a Spider-Man fan,\" says Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada about reports that Obama once collected Spider-Man comics. \"We thought, 'Fantastic! We have a comic-book geek in the White House.' \"\n\nThe White House transition team did not respond to a question about the extent of Obama's comic-book geekiness, but Obama did mention Spider-Man during the campaign, primarily at children-oriented events. And during an Entertainment Weekly pop culture survey, Obama said Batman and Spider-Man were his top superheroes because of their \"inner turmoil.\" (John McCain picked Batman.)\n\nIn the story by Zeb Wells, Todd Nauck and Frank D'Armata, Spider-Man stops the Chameleon from spoiling Obama's swearing-in. At one point, Spider-Man says he mistook Vice President-elect Joe Biden for the Vulture (a vintage Spider-Man villain).\n\nThe issue, selling for $3.99 at comic-book specialty shops (find one at comicshoplocator.com), is expected to be an instant sellout, especially because the Obama cover, by Phil Jimenez, is limited to half the run.\n\n\"This issue will have a lot of heat and go for premium prices. I already have people calling about it,\" says Alan Giroux, owner of All About Books and Comics in Phoenix. \"I expect this will be on the collectors' market for $20 by the first day.\"\n\nPresidents have been supporting characters in comics before: During World War II, superheroes fought Hitler as FranklinD. Roosevelt cheered them on. John F. Kennedy appeared in Action Comics #309 in 1963, when he helped protect Clark Kent's secret identity.\n\n\"If I can't trust the president of the United States, who can I trust?\" Superman tells Kennedy.\n\nThat issue appeared a week after Kennedy was assassinated. DC Comics had to explain later that it was too late to recall the book.\n\nPresidents have appeared as more shadowy figures in recent years.\n\n\"We do our best to be completely non-partisan and treat presidents with respect,\" Quesada says.\n\n\"This is not so much a pro-Obama statement but a tip of the hat to having a Spider-Man fan in the White House.\"\n\nWould McCain have gotten a special issue had he won?\n\nSays Quesada: \"If McCain was a Spider-Man fan, I'm sure he would.\"\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

        "instruction": "BUENOS AIRES, July 2— When Manfred Shonfeld, a newspaper columnist, stepped from a taxi last week and was greeted by someone wearing brass knuckles, he learned the limits of press freedom in Argentina.\n\nMr. Shonfeld lost five teeth, but, undeterred, he was back at his typewriter several days later. ''They failed again,'' wrote the widely read columnist, who has become boldly critical of the military Government in recent months. ''The man is writing again. And he will continue to do so -God willing, beginning next week - in the same manner, about the same themes, with similar focus and identical tone as before.''\n\nThe assailants were unidentified, and the Government condemned the attack. It was only the latest in a series of incidents directed against Mr. Shonfeld's paper, La Prensa, one of the most anti-Government newspapers in the country. Government Removed Its Ads\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Government removed from the paper almost all of its notices and advertisements for state enterprises. Last week, several men barged into the newsroom, identified themselves as policemen and said they would return shortly to censor the next issue.\n\nThey did not, but a group calling itself the New Argentina Command claimed responsibility for the intrusion and for the attack on Mr. Shonfeld. The wide assessment here is that it is one of many small, right-wing extremist groups with links to the police or military.\n\nThe military does not impose prior censorship on the press. But under the state of siege it maintains, it has arrested editors for printing articles on subversive activity and has banned the sale of issues of magazines carrying articles deemed morally threatening to the family or supporting Communism.\n\nMore than 60 journalists have disappeared since the military took power in a coup five years ago. Such disappearances have stopped since last year, but the other actions against the press have been enough to produce an effective self-censorship. Some editors check with military authorities before publishing questionable articles. Little Reporting on Disappearances\n\nWith the exception of The Buenos Aires Herald, a small but influential English-language paper, all Argentine papers have steered away from reporting on disappearance and allegations of torture, usually consigning occasional small articles on habeas corpus suits to the back pages.\n\nIn the last year, however, many newspapers have become increasingly critical of the Government's economic policies and are beginning to question the military itself. None is bolder than La Prensa, which has seen its circulation rise from its normal 85,000 to about 100,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe paper's tone and philosophy is set by Maximo Gainza, the fourth publisher in a family line that started the newspaper 113 years ago. La Prensa staunchly defends civil and individual rights and the capitalist economy and has little love for military dictatorships.\n\n''It was an absurd measure,'' Mr. Gainza said of the Government's removal of its advertising. ''It's been tried so many times before, and it does not work with this newspaper.''\n\nThe campaign against La Prensa began when Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore, an Air Force general, was angered by the paper's charges that he had been imperious in pushing through highway and other projects. He began withholding some city notices, and his complaints to his military colleagues found sympathy. Called Officers Cowards\n\nLa Prensa had begun to break with others papers 18 months ago when it published a list of more than 4,000 people who had disappeared. Its reporting stays with bare facts, but its columnists in recent months have repeatedly criticized the military. One column by Mr. Shonfeld all but called military officers cowards for not acknowledging responsibility for those who have disappeared.\n\nWhen the advertisements stopped, Mr. Gainza sent a reporter to interview Gen. Alberto Ortiz, the Public Information Secretary, and his comments were printed on page one the next day. ''As there is freedom of the press, there is freedom to choose recipients of publicity,'' he was reported to have said.\n\nA few Government ads have crept back into the paper, and General Ortiz now denies he ever ordered them cut. In the meantime, public response has been overwhelming. The Publishers' Association called the removal of advertising a ''brutish reaction'' and ''an attack that clashes painfully with the democratic sensibilities of our country.'' Readers have placed paid notices in the paper to express support.",

        "instruction": "When the corporate cash dam bursts, everything will be ok, right? Well, maybe.\n\nInvestors betting that the past year of more than 20 percent gains in western stock markets can be echoed, or at least sustained, through 2014 have long assumed that a corporate spending revival will nurture a building economic recovery.\n\nThe argument is simple. Years of banking crises, credit droughts and economic uncertainty have prevented businesses investing for the future. Instead, they have clipped costs, wages and jobs and built up huge stockpiles of cash rather than investing in new plants, staff, updated technology, equipment or acquisitions.\n\nAs the economic fog lifts, this idle, near zero-yielding cash will surely be put back to work eventually, they argue, creating a potentially virtuous circle of greater demand, higher growth, earnings and employment all round.\n\nThe problem, however, is that assumes cash stockpiling has all been due simply to a hiatus in the economic cycle. Many argue the hoarding is instead driven by more durable demographic trends and political reforms that are stirring corporate anxiety about exposure to soaring pension and healthcare costs as workforces age and government coffers shrink.\n\nIf that's true, then this brewing economic recovery may not release pent-up business cash on any scale close to that suggested by the eye-popping cashpiles.\n\n(Read more: US companies hold record cash)",

But despite the recession, which should reduce borrowing, the bond market has rallied only erratically and half-heartedly.\n\nThat the bon d market was in trouble long be fore Ronald Reagan's inauguration has been small comfort to those economists who argued that all elements of American capitalism woul d respond enthusiastically to the clarion call of suppl y-side economics.\n\nSome Reagan advisers have shown their bitter disappointment in Wall Street by suggesting punitive credit-control measures to whip the boys in the Street into line. In fact, the proper response for the Administration would be to take the bond market's misgivings seriously.\n\nThe market's message is that the United States cannot sustain both a large Federal deficit - say, at 3.7 percent of the gross national product -and a stable long-term market. Some supply-siders have tended to convert this message into the relatively narrow argument that a large Federal deficit inevitably and single-handedly produces inflation.\n\nCertainly, the bond market worries about inflation. ''As yields rise, prices fall'' is the immutable principle of the market. Roaring inflation and its accompanying interest rates have sent bond prices plunging, though recently there has been some relief. But the importance of inflation is not that it raises interest rates but that it destabilizes them. If interest rates were merely high, the bond market would restabilize itself at the high rates, and long-term financing would go on as before.\n\nSuch restabilization is unlikely so long as the elephantine Federal Government is in the credit markets to finance its deficit. Federal needs push aside fellow public borrowers, like cities and states, and corporate borrowers that would use the money to finance productive expansion. The Federal Government's share of all private and public borrowing went from 19 percent in the late 1950's to 36 percent in 1980.\n\nThis has happened because the Federal Government is willing to pay whatever interest rate the market demands. Washington can always outbid every other bidder for capital - no matter how necessary or productive the other uses might be. And even when its own gluttony for credit has unsettled the markets, Washington ends up with its appetite satisfied because investors ''flee to quality'' in uncertain times: They choose the safest debt instrument that, given Washington's ability to pay off its $147 billion worth of net new debts with its own printed money, will be Washington. The flight to quality results in more volatile prices in a thinner market, where investors are replaced by speculators - an unknown phenomenon 15 years ago.\n\nIn the meantime, other users who need long-term debt cannot afford to compete with the Government. They sell their debt on the market's terms, which these days means both high rates and short duration. Corporations have been financing themselves to a frightening degree with commercial paper (unsecured, short-term notes), a market that last year grew $45 billion, to $165 billion.\n\nCorporations also pay a price when their home cities and states are shut out of the long-term market, for these governments inevitably must permit crucial public facilities to deteriorate. As public services decline, economies tend to decline.\n\nHalf the country's communities are unable to permit existing firms to expand or new plants to move in because water-treatment facilities are at or near capacity, according to a study published in August by the Council of State Planning Agencies. The latest Commerce Department figures show that spending on public projects ranging from schools to sewerage and water systems has declined 24 percent since January 1981. No turnaround is in sight.\n\nWhat is in sight is the end of the long-term bond market. No politically or economically turbulent country has one. The volatility of high inflation combined with high interest rates is moving us toward the practice in England, where a five-year bond is ''long-term'' and a 30-year bond is unheard of.\n\nAmerica's bond market has been a working tribute to the country's political system. As long as we had a 30-year market so secure that it was the conventional home for widows' trusts, we didn't need political commentators assuring us that ours was the most stable Government in the world.\n\nIf the Reagan Administration is to save the economy, it must save the long-term bond market first - and soon. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Julia Vitullo-Martin, a financial consultant, is writing a book about American financing.",

        "instruction": "With its game mechanics and spunky badges, Foursquare could easily be mistaken for a frivolous mobile application with little to no value for businesses. As the startup races to the million member milestone, however, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nWe've already written about Foursquare's savvy relationships with major media and entertainment brands and even talked about how it's changing the world as we know it. In this post, we'll delve deeper into the big brands and businesses that are experimenting with the platform and finding success with location-sharing.\n\nFor proof that Foursquare is a viable tool for businesses, take a gander at the City of Chicago and their efforts to make city exploration fun with Foursquare, the Wynn Las Vegas' unique approach to top notch service, Tasti D-Lite's efforts to redefine the customer loyalty program, Lucky Magazine's interest in taking their editorial content to the streets and Starbucks' desire to better understand their customers.\n\nLuxury hotels like the Wynn Las Vegas and Encore cater to guests with refined interests. That's what makes the company's interest in Foursquare's location-sharing application all the more intriguing.\n\nJade Bailey, the Estrategy Development Manager for the Wynn and Encore hotels, says that she started to notice Foursquare checkins at the hotels about six months ago. She has since acted to engage with checked-in guests and seed locations inside the hotels with colorful tips, facts and stories that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, a Foursquare tip will reveal that the red chandeliers in Encore were inspired by the twirling of a women's skirt and are made from Murano glass.\n\nFor the Wynn and Encore, the Foursquare strategy has less to do with besting the Vegas competition and more about complimenting and improving the overall service provided by the hotels.\n\nTo that purpose they've recently started a promotion that offers their Foursquare guests an even more luxurious experience. A recently launched special prompts checked-in guests with an opportunity to enjoy a glass of champagne at the Blush Boutique nightclub on the house, for example.\n\nBailey also goes above and beyond to cater to the wishes of guests who express their needs publicly via Foursquare but not directly to the hotel. As an example, Bailey says that a recent hotel guest was checked-in at one of the hotel's restaurants, so she reached out to the restaurant manager and passed along the photo of the guest. The restaurant manager then made it a point to greet and attend to the guest in question.\n\nBailey's active involvement with guests via Foursquare has been met with positive response from customers and has been encouraged by senior management. Moving forward, she says the hotel plans to use the business dashboard to \"refine our approach to service and learn more about our guests.\"\n\nAs the third largest city in the United States, Chicago's developed a reputation for being the heart of America and owes some of its visibility to patron pop culture icon Oprah Winfrey. The city is also known for its newsworthy weather and airports that notoriously strand passengers.\n\nWhat we know of Chicago and what Chicago really is are two different realities, however, and that's where the ExploreChicago Foursquare initiative comes into play. The city's badge-style approach — themed around Chicago's unique way of life — to encourage visitors and residents to unlock the history and culture of Chicago is truly avant-garde. Foursquare users can tap into hidden treasures in 77 different neighborhoods, explore 552 parks, and dine at more than 7,000 Chicago restaurants.\n\nAs the Chicago Office of Tourism's web specialist, Sarah Best speaks to the opportunities that Foursquare creates with palpable enthusiasm. She describes it as a \"new way to get people out and about in the city\" and finds the spill over onto Twitter and social media, with people \"live blogging their efforts to unlock all three badges in one day,\" as exciting proof that the city is on the right track.\n\nBest is also enthralled by how city partners on the initiative — like the Art Institute of Chicago — are inspired by the potential to bring the city to life and are actively promoting their participation in the game.\n\nFor example, the Art Institute used their popular Facebook Page to highlight that Gallery 240 is where Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off became captivated by Georges Seurat's, \"A Sunday on La Grande Jatte.\" Of course those attempting to unlock the \"On Location\" badge would become privy to that tidbit of Chicago lore while traveling and re-experiencing the city's magical movie moments.\n\nAdventurers in Chi-town this weekend can try their hand at the city's Foursquare-themed Movie Madness tweetup with a twist. Attendees will be tasked to form teams and complete an On Location checkin race. Winners will literally see their names in lights on the Chicago Marquee.\n\nThe City of Chicago's Foursquare endeavor proves that the city has something for everyone.\n\nFashion-conscious women of the world look to the editors of fashion magazines to help inspire their seasonal wardrobe choices. It's a trust-based relationship that bonds the reader to their publication of choice. Condé Nast property Lucky Magazine recognizes the significance of this relationship and is turning to digital mediums to further extend that bond and make the brand more relevant to their customers' lives.\n\nWhen it comes to Foursquare the magazine received kudos for their intelligently crafted Fashion Week tie-ins that provided tips and to-dos on where to find WiFi or grab a cup of coffee, but the longer term initiative is much more impressive. The magazine has decided to use Foursquare as a digital means to promote tips from their editor-curated list of more than 600 stores nationwide.\n\nMary Gail Pezzimenti and Leslie Price of Condé Nast are both drawn to Foursquare and find that these location-based offerings create a cyclical connection between magazine, retailer and reader and provides them with a way to measure response.\n\nLucky — independent of working with Foursquare — has spent considerable time and money employing editors around the nation to hunt down the best local deals and designers in order to establish this curated directory of the best boutiques by city. Over the past three weeks the content from this directory has been seeded into Foursquare. This adds instant value and puts bite-sized tips into the pockets of their shopaholic readers who can happen upon them when they're out and about shopping.\n\nAs Lucky's web director, Pezzimenti believes that \"Foursquare adds enormous service to our readers,\" because, \"we want women who are out shopping to think of Lucky, connect with Lucky, engage with Lucky.\"\n\nPezzimenti also believes that there's much more opportunity to be had and notes that women, \"look to magazine editors to provide insider tips. This is the perfect form to deliver insider info instantly.\"\n\nOn that front, Price — the magazine's Online Editor — says you can expect Lucky's senior editors to develop more of a personal presence on Foursquare (likely via the new celebrity feature) and directly engage one-on-one with readers. The magazine is also exploring ways to highlight tips from their fashion-savvy readers and has plans to promote their Foursquare presence in a print issue later this summer.\n\nThe idea of the social media loyalty program was first put into practice by Tasti D-Lite, a popular frozen dessert company offering trendy alternatives to traditional ice cream. The company's roots are in New York, where they've managed to become a part of the city's diction, but its cross-country and worldwide expansion efforts are heavily reliant on social media spreading the Tasti D-Lite message beyond New York City.\n\nEnter TastiRewards, the Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare-heavy rewards program that is integrated with the company's Point-of-Sale (POS) system. Customers register their TreatCards online, configure their social media accounts, and then earn points — which can be redeemed for freebies — for each purchase and online status update.\n\nSince its beta launch just over two months ago, the program has been rolled out to nearly 30 locations, mostly in upper east side New York. Social technology officer BJ Emerson states that, \"the rate at which people are going online to register is increasing week over week\" and that ultimately it helps corporate \"push relationships down to the local level and encourage store owners to engage with customers.\"\n\nThe program represents the first opportunity the company has ever had to unite franchises under one loyalty program and still keep store owners happy with performance-based metrics. Plus, the location-sharing aspect of it is crucial to spreading brand awareness during the company's expansion initiatives.\n\nTo further encourage those public status updates, Tasti D-Lite is already experimenting by populating those automatic updates with coupons that a customer's friends and followers can redeem at store locations. Emerson says that there may be plans to evolve this so, the \"POS system would generate a unique coupon code for a user,\" and \"that link could be tracked for redemptions,\" so that the company could, \"potentially reward extra points for the referrals.\"\n\nCheck-in to any Starbucks location on Foursquare and you will be one checkin closer to unlocking your very own official Starbucks Barista badge. Right now that badge might not amount to anything more than bragging rights, but that should change in the coming months.\n\nWith the experimental customer rewards program underway, the coffee retailer is exploring ways to reward regulars for their continued check-ins with special prizes, as well as better understand customer behavior.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson tells us:\n\n\"Starbucks recently announced a relationship with Foursquare, which enables us to engage with our customers in unique ways by breaking down barriers of digital and physical worlds. Foursquare is another way for Starbucks to take the pulse of the experience in physical stores in real time and hear feedback from our customers.\"\n\nFor now the badge is enough to encourage Starbucks location-sharing activity and battles over mayorship, which will help Starbucks on their mission to tune into the individual vibe of each venue.",

        "instruction": "WIESBADEN, West Germany— FEW recent events have produced as much confusion or as sharp a clash between public interest and individual privacy over the issue of medical confidentiality - as have the physical and mental health of the freed hostages.\n\nOn one side were Government officials and the doctors that treated the 52 patients at the United States Air Force hospital here. They acted to give the former hostages time to decompress before meeting with journalists. They acted, as well, by protecting one of the oldest medical canons - the confidentiality of the patient-doctor relationship - to avoid satisfying public curiosity at the patients' expense.\n\nOn the other side were more than 1,000 journalists whose aim was equally serious - to report as much specific information as they could gather about the extent and severity of the medical and psychological symptoms among the returnees.\n\nFor centuries, doctors have sworn to Hippocrates to protect confidentiality. They believe any restraints that would encourage a patient to withhold crucial information might impair a physician's diagnostic and therapeutic abilities. Accordingly, doctors cannot discuss medical information in specific cases without approval of the patient.\n\nThe Government's policy here was to let the hostages disclose the nature of their own conditions. Few subjects are more delicate to many Americans than their mental health. Many people who are delighted to tell about their operations do not want a word known about their emotional ailments.\n\nIt was a delicate issue, because the hostages had become involved in an incident of tremendous international importance through no choice of their own. Their medical conditions became all the more significant when the State Department and former President Carter charged ''serious mistreatment'' during the captivity.\n\nAlmost from the first, when the Americans were seized in the Nov. 4, 1979 takeover of the embassy in Teheran, the United States Government had a medical team ready to meet the hostages upon their release. Because the Government deemed their care of national interest, it was reasonable for reporters to infer the same was true of the general medical results.\n\nHowever, there was confusion almost from the earliest news conferences when Government officials described the former hostages as being in varying states of health, with some in need of psychiatric aid. Incomplete and contradictory reports about the state of their mental health followed.\n\nOn the day before the former hostages held their first news conference at West Point, James Brady, the White House press secretary, disclosed that ''a dozen or so'' of the freed hostages still had ''severe'' mental problems. His remarks left the impression that those who did not attend the news briefing were among that dozen. But the following day White House officials said that conclusion was invalid.\n\nState Department doctors said they did not know where the White House got its statistics. Dr. Jerome M. Korcak, the Department's medical director and head of the medical team treating the group, partially clarified the situation when he said that the number with ''severe'' mental health problems was about three or four and that the remainder of the 12 had less serious psychiatric conditions.\n\nDr. Korcak also confirmed that two hostages had attempted suicide during their 444 days of captivity in Iran. But there were contradictions about whether the doctors were keeping suicide watches on some former hostages, as might be customary for seriously depressed patients.\n\nSociety in recent years has agreed to many changes in the once rigid confidentiality of the patient-doctor relationship. The scope of the health team has expanded to include many people who have access to information that once was held sacrosanct and who are not bound by the ethical canon of confidentiality that is imposed on doctors.\n\nNow that third-party health insurance companies pay most medical bills, many nonprofessionals know precise details about an individual's health problems. Under Federally mandated Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSRO) programs, nonprofessionals review once-confidential medical information to evaluate quality of hospital care.\n\nAs medicine and society have become more complex, many patients are treated by teams of doctors who share information. And doctors who work for government and industry may have divided loyalties when they examine patients. The public's interest in the health of an airline pilot, for example, may rival, even exceed, that of the patient.\n\nThe Government's charges that the hostages were physically and mentally abused made public issues of such specific information about their overall health as whether the alleged barbaric acts had permanent effects and whether they involved a large or small number of the group.\n\nUnfortunately, innocent people are often involved in events of legitimate public interest. Although some confusion may exist when doctors and government officials try to protect such medical confidentiality, there are ways to create less confusion than was the case with the hostages.\n\nPamphlets explaining the overall medical goals could be distributed. A doctor could attend all news briefings to explain what is known and why specific answers cannot be given to certain questions. Doctors attended only one news conference here in Wiesbaden. At the others, Jack Cannon, the State Department's chief spokesman, said he could not answer medical questions because he was not a doctor.\n\nThe informational vacuum encouraged news organizations to pay patients and hospital employees to secretly tape interviews and to take pictures of the former hostages in what should have been the privacy of the hospital. News accounts included words such as ''basket case'' and ''very bad condition,'' gathered from hospital employees and relatives who had no training in medicine but had access to the hostages. It was not clear if the descriptions were accurate or if they were issued with the patients' approval.\n\nDoctors could have presented data in more standard and meaningful ways. When Dr. Korcak disclosed that the hostages' weight loss in captivity ranged from 10 to 80 pounds, confusion resulted because the data were presented anecdotally. He did not say how many lost 80 pounds, how many lost 10 pounds, and how the losses compared to weights before captivity.\n\nAbove all, accuracy and the appearance of accuracy should be a primary goal for all concerned. Mr. Cannon had to retract a statement that the former hostages had met and ''unanimously'' voted not to speak to journalists while they were here after several former hostages told reporters that they were not part of such a meeting and had not cast such a vote.\n\nThe cumulative effect of the confusion created an impression that the patient-doctor relationship was used as a cloak to limit public information about a subject of legitimate public interest. Such politicization of a medical canon, if indeed it occurred, should be avoided in future cases.",

        "instruction": "Romanian social-democrat Sorin Grindeanu. (AFP)\n\nRomania's president on Friday named social-democrat Sorin Grindeanu as the nation's new prime minister, bringing to a close weeks of uncertainty since the left won a parliamentary vote on December 11.\n\nThe centre-right president Klaus Iohannis signed the official decree naming Grindeanu, a 43-year-old former communications minister, as the new premier.\n\nGrindeanu now faces a confidence vote in parliament on his programme and cabinet nominees. The vote must take place within the next 10 days.\n\nHe later told reporters he would seek parliamentary approval on January 4 and hold a government meeting on the evening of that same day.\n\nThe nomination sought to end a political crisis sparked when Iohannis rejected a previous candidate who would have been the country's first female and first Muslim prime minister.\n\nThe president offered no reasons for his rejection of Sevil Shhaideh, initially put forward by the Social Democrats (PSD), but there was speculation that it was due to her Syrian husband's background.\n\nSources close to the president had indicated on Thursday that Grindeanu was considered a \"better solution\".\n\n\"Iohannis is hoping for a smoother, less conflictual coexistence than he had with former prime minister Victor Ponta,\" who was forced to resign in November 2015 after street protests erupted over a deadly nightclub fire.\n\nGrindeanu is seen in Romania as a \"disciplined soldier\" within the PSD ranks and said himself in a recent interview that he had joined the party very young as an outlet for his leftist convictions.\n\nAfter his nomination Wednesday by PSD leader Liviu Dragnea, Grindeanu said he would obey the party chief.\n\n\"Mr Dragnea is the president of the PSD, it's very simple,\" he said.\n\nDragnea had withdrawn his own bid to become prime minister because of a conviction that bars him from office.\n\nDragnea however made no secret of the fact he was looking for a candidate close to him.\n\n\"I wanted a man I could trust, a man who wouldn't use his government position as a springboard,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he would not abandon his own ambitions of power, branding as \"unjust\" the laws barring him from office over charges of electoral fraud.\n\nBefore Grindeanu, the PSD had proposed the previously little-known Shhaideh after its thumping poll victory on December 11 when it won 45 percent of the vote, enough to form a majority coalition with its partners ALDE.\n\nShhaideh, 52, who has only five months ministerial experience, is from Romania's small and long-established Turkish minority, but her Muslim faith is not thought to have been the problem.\n\nInstead it was likely the fact that her husband, 54, had worked in the Syrian agriculture ministry for 20 years before emigrating to Romania in 2011 and marrying Shhaideh the same year, according to the PSD.\n\nWebsite HotNews cited unnamed sources as saying that the security services had \"strongly cautioned\" against Shhaideh's nomination because of the closeness of her husband and his two brothers to President Bashar al-Assad's regime.\n\nThis might have made giving Shhaideh the necessary security clearances to be the NATO member's prime minister problematic.\n\nOn Tuesday after Shhaideh's rejection, Dragnea said the PSD was considering its options including moving to suspend Iohannis or going to the constitutional court.\n\nHowever, any attempt by the PSD to remove the head of state would have been problematic because Iohannis was entitled to request a second proposal for premier.\n\nThe PSD eventually agreed to make a new proposal, stating that it would be their \"final\" effort to avoid \"political war\".\n\nThe PSD's election triumph came barely a year since anger over the nightclub fire that killed 64 people forced it from office.\n\nThe inferno was blamed on corruption -- something Brussels has long complained about since Romania joined the EU in 2007.",

        "instruction": "Predicting the next big thing in pop music is tricky business. It’s a fickle genre by nature and design. What sounds fresh today (hello, Lana Del Rey) can be out of touch a month later. Likewise, plenty of sensations can emerge seemingly out of the blue (two words: “Gangnam Style”). Instead, we’ve rounded up 10 artists who might not have a hit or even come to town but whose music is worth your time and attention this year.\n\nThe Australian singer-songwriter, real name Jessica Newham, honed her chops at the Berklee College of Music and she learned her lessons well, as her four-song 2013 EP, “The Movement,” is a bright bubble of synth pop bliss. The cool blue ballad “Right Here” and the pulsating “Somebody Loves You” — written the week that Whitney Houston passed away and inspired by the pop diva — have us looking forward to finding out what Who is all about. [SR]\n\nA clever and heartfelt country singer-songwriter, Janson made some noise in 2013 with the singles “Better I Don’t” (a simultaneously comic and poignant look at leaving the wild life behind) and “Cut Me Some Slack.” He’s also penned songs for other artists, including Tim McGraw’s hit “Truck Yeah” and collaborated on tunes with everyone from Bill Anderson to Duff McKagan of Guns N’ Roses. That classic country and hard rock combo can be heard in his sound, in which the Missouri native combines an unbridled energy with thoughtful observations and wry humor. Following some stops and starts in the industry, Janson is poised to break through to a bigger audience. [SR]\n\nThink of “Dual,” the seven-song EP that Sampha released last summer, as one long exhale after a deep drag on a cigarette. The British musician comes from a storied line of soulful singers, both old-school (Bill Withers) and neo (D’Angelo), but his brand of R&B is decidedly contemporary. Sampha exists in the new realm where the beats are electronic and minimal, the mood hazy, and the vocals nearly vaporous. He’s closely associated with Jessie Ware and Solange Knowles, with whom he has collaborated, and for good reason: They’re all singers who know the power of a less-is-more approach. [JR]\n\nIt’s amusing to watch someone’s reaction to hearing Avidan for the first time. Take a song like “Different Pulses,” the title track of his 2012 album. Eyebrows arch, and a moment of familiarity flickers across the face. “This sort of sounds like Amy Winehouse.” Or, “Wow, who is this woman?” That woman happens to be a soulful and ethereal Israeli man who has already made quite an impression in his homeland and Europe. An otherworldly quality marks his brand of pop, landing somewhere along the lines of Jeff Buckley and Janis Joplin. After fronting a folk-rock band called Asaf Avidan & the Mojos, Avidan went solo a few years ago and begins his maiden US tour next month. His latest album hasn’t been released here yet, but you can hear bits and pieces of it on YouTube. (Avidan performs at Somerville Theatre on Feb. 22, as part of World Music’s programming.) [JR]\n\nAt “Another Day/Another Time,” a concert back in September celebrating the music from the film “Inside Llewyn Davis,” the lineup was flush with heavy hitters: Joan Baez, Patti Smith, Elvis Costello. But it was a lesser-known band that nearly stole the show. A woman in the mezzanine turned to her neighbors on either side. “Who. Was. That?” she asked after Lake Street Dive delivered an electrifying performance buoyed by powerhouse singer Rachael Price. That excitement rippled throughout the venue after the quartet’s quirky and playful mashup of jazz, folk, and swinging pop. Lake Street Dive, which started in Boston when its members met as students at New England Conservatory, has been kicking around for a while, long enough that it has a digital album titled “Live at the Lizard Lounge.” But with the Feb. 18 release of “Bad Self Portraits,” its next album produced by Arlington resident Sam Kassirer, the foursome is destined to have a breakthrough year. Finally. (Lake Street Dive plays at the Sinclair on Feb. 21; it’s already sold out.) [JR]\n\nUnder the name BANKS (note those caps), the Los Angeles-bred singer and songwriter Jillian Banks has amassed a lot of buzz on the strength of her lone EP, last year’s “London.” Songs like “Waiting Game” and “Before I Ever Met You” ooze a dark-hearted iciness while playing off the warm, sensual tones of Banks’s voice. Half the time she reminds you of the xx; the other half it’s Sade. Her debut album doesn’t have an official release date, but it’s likely due in the spring. In the meantime, she recently placed third in the BBC Sound of 2014, an annual poll of UK music critics and industry types who gauge what to expect in pop music for the year ahead. [JR]\n\nThe hype reached a fever pitch almost immediately after his self-titled debut came out in his native England in 2012. Bugg, who turns 20 next month, is the kind of mop-topped musician whose appeal skips across genres and generations. A father might hear a little bit of early Bob Dylan or the Kinks in Bugg’s pinched voice, while a son might think it sounds like the Tallest Man on Earth. Then there are Bugg’s freewheeling joyrides through plainspoken folk, proto-punk rockers, lonesome country ballads, and modern indie-rock. Still in his teens, he already exudes a confidence and talent beyond his years. (Bugg plays at the House of Blues on Saturday.) [JR]\n\nToward the end of 2013, a year when hip-hop was dominated by high-profile releases from Kanye West, Drake, and A$AP Rocky, a Minneapolis rapper named Lizzo put out an unabashed party album. “LIZZOBANGERS” was her debut, and inexplicably flew under the radar, but it was jammed with big beats and an even bigger presence from its creator. Raised in both Detroit and Houston, Lizzo claims an array of influences, from gospel to Southern soul to ’90s R&B girl groups. She credits Destiny’s Child with inspiring her to make her own music, which she has done in a hodgepodge of bands in various genres. But as a rapper, she has found the perfect outlet for her kinetic wordplay (witness “Batches & Cookies”), wicked sense of humor, and penchant for brash live performances. With any luck, she’ll find her audience this year, be it in a sweaty club or a massive arena. [JR]\n\nIf you’re a contemporary country music fan you know Stapleton’s songs. He’s written over 150 that have been cut by some of the biggest names in Nashville including Kenny Chesney, George Strait, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert, Little Big Town, and Brad Paisley. Thanks to his big, soulful voice — which bluegrass aficionados may recognize from his time in the Grammy-nominated SteelDrivers — the Kentucky native is also an in-demand backing vocalist. On the heels of his 2013 single “What Are You Listening To?” Stapleton is finally heading out on his own as a solo artist and, after a wonderful performance at a songwriters’ round at the Hard Rock Cafe this past October, we expect his debut album will be one of the answers to that musical question in 2014. [SR]\n\nAn 81-year-old Delta blues musician is an artist to watch in 2014? Yep, Welch is. On Tuesday the guitarist and singer, who cut his teeth in the church and has been largely overlooked outside the South, released his debut album. “Sabougla Voices” pays homage to the Mississippi town where he grew up with a steely, electric take on gospel informed by the blues. As Welch notes in the album’s press materials, he doesn’t see much difference between the genres: “I believe in the Lord, but the blues speaks to life too. Blues has a feeling just like gospel; they just don’t have a book (a Bible).” His new album is full of feisty songs meant for shouting, stomping, and testifying. Can Welch get an amen? [JR]",

        "instruction": "AUSTIN, Tex., June 23— It was a tale of Texan proportions, complete with epic name-calling, massive lobbying and political skulduggery. It was Ross Perot's foray into the turbulent world of education reform -- and it offers a rare chance to examine how he operates in a political arena.\n\nMr. Perot proved he could learn quickly, sell bold policies to the public and ram them through a reluctant Legislature. But he also showed a taste for attention-grabbing invective that alienated some of the very people whose help he needed to change the state's education system.\n\nIn 1984, Texas adopted one of the most sweeping education laws in its history, paid for by its first state tax increase in 13 years. Although he must share credit with top state officials, it was Mr. Perot who led the charge. It was he who barnstormed the state in his own jet convening public hearings on Texas's schools. It was his biting one-liners that sold many Texans on the changes. It was his money that paid for one of the biggest lobbying efforts this state capital had ever witnessed. Measure of Leadership\n\nMr. Perot touts the $2.8 billion education package as proof that business methods, plain speaking and listening to people are indeed what it takes to forge policies, make changes and lead a nation. The law established a state preschool program for children with disadvantages, shifted school aid from rich to poor districts, reduced class sizes in early grades, toughened academic standards, mandated testing for teachers and raised teachers' salaries but linked raises to performance. And in a state where football reigned supreme, the law required students to pass all their courses or give up extracurricular activities like team sports.\n\nTo shake up education in Texas, Mr. Perot used the very methods he says he would apply as President to all national policies: Convene experts; hold extensive public meetings; decide on a policy; and beat back every attempt to compromise it.\n\nMr. Perot did not answer messages left at his headquarters requesting comment on his role in the education law.\n\nIt is clear that for all Mr. Perot's protestations about the evils of political action committees and political insiders, he knew how to leverage his considerable influence and money to railroad opponents.\n\n\"It was like being in a sword fight with a pocket knife,\" said Eddie Joseph, executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association. The coaches fought Mr. Perot bitterly on the law, along with most Texas teachers unions, the state board of education and several powerful legislators.\n\nIt is less certain whether Mr. Perot could have succeeded had he actually been in government. He did not have to worry about angering those whose support might be crucial for re-election. Some of his opponents say his acid tongue and occasional strong-arm tactics alienated many school insiders.\n\nRidiculing the widespread practice of making coaches principals, for example, Mr. Perot would ask all administrators to stand up during the public hearings he held across the state, recalled Becky Brooks, a teachers union lobbyist. Then he would ask those who were coaches to sit down. Nearly everybody sat, proving Mr. Perot's point, but humiliating coaches and many administrators.\n\nNor do observers agree on the lasting impact of the education law, although most believe it marked a dramatic step forward for Texas schools. Texas Whirlwind More Than State Had Bargained For\n\nThe education law that Mr. Perot helped shape and pass sought far-reaching changes. It gave Texas a preschool program for poor and non-English-speaking children. It transformed school finances, the state's first step toward redressing huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts.\n\nTeachers received raises, but had to pass a competency test to keep their jobs. The law set maximum class sizes of 22 in early grades and required high-school students to pass a proficiency test to graduate. The infamous \"no pass, no play\" rule took on some of Texas's most sacred institutions, including football and county fairs, by forbidding students who failed a course to participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nTexas officials had not planned on legislation so sweeping. But Gov. Mark White had promised teachers raises, and he decided he needed an influential businessman to help persuade the Legislature to raise the taxes to pay for them. In June 1983 he asked Mr. Perot to head a Select Committee on Public Education. 9-Month Investigation\n\nGovernor White got more than he had bargained for. Mr. Perot set the committee's agenda from the start, plunging it into a nine-month investigation of Texas schools. He paid education experts to testify before his committee, commissioned surveys of Texas teachers, held committee meetings in plush Dallas hotels with catered meals, flew an entourage of about 50 people around the state for public hearings and paid Thomas W. Luce, a prominent attorney and now head of his petition drive, to manage the effort.\n\nMr. Perot did not like what he found, and he told Texans so in blunt, uncompromising terms. Texas had world-class education in only a few areas, he said: \"drill team, band and football.\" The state would no longer be able to count on oil to stay prosperous; it's children would need solid educations to compete in a high-technology world.",

        "instruction": "SINGAPORE— Hans Johannes Hoefer's passion for travel took him to places many people only dream of going to. He has seen the sunset from the summit of one of the world's highest passes in the Hindu Kush mountains, visited hill tribes in Malaysia a nd lived in a village in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nIn 1970, he and a couple of friends started APA Productions Ltd. and began publishing books about the places they had seen - glossy, insightful paperbacks that cost too much to be considered tourist guides, were too heavy for backpackers, too literary for many tourists and too small to pass for coffee table books. They sold anyway, about one million copies.\n\nBy publishing standards, APA, which has its headquarters in Singapore, is still very small. It has a staff of 30, and its sales in 1981 amounted to about $1.6 million. But in the last two years, with the establishment of the APA photo agency, which expanded the company's business into contract photography, audio-visual services and brochure design, production and printing, APA is fast becoming a profitable little dream machine.\n\nMr. Hoefer realized that the hundreds of pages of research and thousands of photographs that did not go into the books would be wasted unless used in some other way. So APA formed the photo agency to provide customers such as the Hong Kong Tourist Commission, Singapore Airlines and Rollei, the West German camera maker, with color photographs of exotic places. Expansion Planned\n\nNow looking for new markets to feed its expanding publishing capabilities, APA's wanderers-turned-executives are talking about building a mini-publishing empire that would include the United States and Europe. ''By 1983, we expect to have an editor for Europe and the Mediterranean,'' said Mr. Hoefer, who is German.\n\nAPA's office in the United States is in Honolulu. Until recently, Hawaii was the only state that had its own APA guide. Now in its ninth printing, the Insight Guide Hawaii, which came out in 1980, has sold 105,000 copies. But Hawaii has the advantage of being exotic, like the sites of APA's other guides - Thailand, Bali and Burma -and places where guidebooks are planned, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\nFor its first book on an American state other than Hawaii, APA chose Florida. After 10 books on Asia and one on Hawaii, Mr. Hoefer thought it was time to try APA's style on one of America's largest tourist markets. A thick pink guide was produced, with everything a traveler might want to know about Florida. ''We are treating Florida like a country,'' he said. Hopeful on Florida Book\n\n''Forty million people go there every year,'' said Mr. Hoefer, who estimated that, compared with Burma, where only 30,000 people are admitted on seven-day visas each year, Florida offered APA a good chance for success. The Burma book, in print for about six weeks, has already sold 12,000 copies. The Florida book, which comes out this month, need sell only twice that to begin inching into profitability.\n\nMost of APA's books break even at about 25,000 copies. Last year, the company p rinted more than 300,000 copies of its books, and has six more book s in the works.\n\nAPA fills an unexpected void in the publishing world of travel guides. ''We did books for a certain kind of person and ended up selling to others,'' said Mr. Hoefer, whose first book on Bali was written for people like himself, the traveler not the tourist. The difference, Mr. Hoefer believes, is that tourists want to know how to get there and travelers want to know why they should go. Help From Hotel Chains\n\nBut APA's sales have depended on neither. The first book on Bali was a success because Intercontinental Hotels, which lent Mr. Hoefer $50,000 to produce the book, used it for promotion. The Hawaii book was also instantly profitable when a Hyatt hotel, Hemmeter Center, bought the first run of 23,000 books.\n\nThere have been a number of bulk sales, but most of the books have probably been bought by armchair travelers. ''I am still not sure who buys our books,'' Mr. Hoefer said. ''Some buy them for the photos or for souvenirs. But at $17.50 they are expensive as guides, though for what they are, they are very cheap.''\n\nEach guide has at least 300 color photographs taken by a number of photographers. Writers and specialists in local folklore and history write the text, and an editor brings it together. Every year or so, the guide is updated. The Bali guide is now in its ninth reprinting.\n\nFor exotic places, the APA combination of Rolling Stone magazine and The National Geographic worked well. It is a style that European readers seem to enjoy. But the American audience is still a question.\n\nGeo magazine, which incorporated a similar style, was very successful in Europe but had trouble in the United States. Of his Florida publication, Mr. Hoefer said: ''We don't know if it will work; we will just have to give it a try. Just in case it does, APA has already begun work on its next state guide, on California.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Hans Johannes Hoefer photo of travel book series",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, May 26— Two senior officials of the Justice Department strongly recommended the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive financier, tried to bribe White House officials in the Carter Administration, according to newly released Government documents. But no special prosecutor was appointed.\n\nThe recommendations were made in July 1979 by Philip B. Heymann, then Assistant Attorney General in charge of the department's criminal division, and Thomas H. Henderson Jr., then chief of the public integrity section of the criminal division.\n\nIn a 30-page memorandum to Mr. Heymann on June 21, 1979, Mr. Henderson said that the Vesco investigation, including evidence of possible perjury by a White House aide and allegations of a ''coverup'' by Justice Department lawyers, ''cries out for a statutory special proseecutor.'' Mr. Heymann concurred, saying, ''This is precisely the type of situation in which Congress intended a detached special prosecutor.''\n\nHowever, Michael J. Egan, who was Associate Attorney General at the time, refused to request an independent prosecutor. He said that he was precluded from doing so by a section of the special prosecutor law that exempted investigations in progress at the time of its enactment and related allegations received in a 90-day transition period. Two Higher-ups Disqualified\n\nIn a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Egan said that his decision had been final because the Attorney General, Griffin B. Bell, and the Deputy Attorney General, Benjamin R. Civiletti, had disqualified themselves. Mr. Egan said that Justice Department lawyers in the office of legal counsel had supported his reading of the law.\n\nMr. Bell and Mr. Civiletti had disqualified themselves because it was possible they might be called as witnesses to discuss their involvement in an earlier phase of the case.\n\nThe White House aide who was under grand jury investigation for possible perjury was Richard M. Harden, President Carter's special assistant for budget and organization. Mr. Egan said that he and Mr. Harden had been friends in Georgia when Jimmy Carter was Governor, but that he never discussed the case with Mr. Harden. Mr. Egan had been Republican leader of the Georgia House of Representatives; Mr. Harden had served on Governor Carter's staff.\n\nMr. Harden, reached yesterday at his home in McLean, Va., raid the perjury case against him had been ''dreamed up by some enterprising young lawyer in the Justice Department.'' Mr. Harden, now a 36-yearold private consultant, said, ''I didn't do anything wrong and I certainly didn't commit perjury.'' Current Views on Recommendation\n\nMr. Henderson remains a Justice Department lawyer but is no longer chief of the public integrity section. He said last week that his recommendation for a special prosecutor ''still looks good in retrospect.''\n\nMr. Heymann, who has left government to rejoin the faculty of Harvard Law School, said he remembered his recommendation but did not want to discuss it because it was an internal Justice Department matter.\n\nThe Vesco case was a subject of Congressional hearings and much debate in the Carter Administration, but the request for a special prosecutor had not previously been disclosed. The Justice Department resisted disclosure of the documents dealing with appointment of aspecial prosecutor and turned them over to Senate investigators only after being ordered to do so last March by a Federal judge.\n\nA Senate Judiciary subcommittee had sought the documents as part of an investigation into the Justice Department's handling of political corruption cases. The investigation is still going on. A copy of the documents was made available to The New York Times by Government officials who said they believed that a special prosecutor should have been appointed. Vesco's Legal Problems\n\nMr. Vesco, a wealthy financier, fled the United Stater in 1972 when he faced charges of making an illegal contribution to President Nixon's re-election campaign and swindling millions of dollars from mutual-fund investors. Jack Anderson, the columnist, reported in September 1978 that Mr. Vesco, through several intermediaries, had tried to exert improper influence on the Administration of President Carter to resolve his legal problems.\n\nR.L. Herring, a south Georgia businessman, alleged that several offshore corporations controlled by Mr. Vesco were to be used as conduits to liquidate and distribute $10 million worth of stock that was ultimately to be used to bribe Carter aides. Mr. Herring was convicted in 1978 of fraud and racketeering charges unrelated to the Vesco inquiry.\n\nAfter investigating the Vesco matter, including the Harden case, from November 1978 to April 1980, a Federal grand jury here decided not to return any indictments. Mr. Harden's lawyer said the decision showed his client was ''completely innocent.'' Mr. Harden told a Senate judiciary subcommittee last December that ''no illegal overtures to the White House were ever made.''\n\nJustice Department officials in 1979 drafted a charter authorizing a special prosecutor to investigate whether Mr. Harden had committed perjury in his testimony before the grand jury on Dec. 20, 1978. Details of this testimony remain secret. Henderson Links Two Cases\n\nMr. Henderson said in the 1979 memorandum to Mr. Heymann that the ''Harden perjury matter'' was ''inextricably intertwined'' with the entire Vesco investigation. Therefore, he wrote, ''it is our firm opinion that our application for a special prosecutor should include all related matters, including the coverup allegations.''\n\nThe Ethics in Government Act, which took effect on Oct. 26, 1978, requires the Attorney General to conduct a preliminary investigation whenever he receives ''specific information'' alleging that a highranking Federal official has committed a crime. He then must ask a panel of three Federal judges to appoint a special prosecutor unless he finds the matter ''so unsubstantiated that no further investigation or prosecution is warranted.'' The judges must appoint a special prosecutor if the Attorney General requests one.\n\nIn recommending a special prosecutor, Mr. Heymann cited what he called an ''inherent implausibility'' in parts of Mr. Harden's story and ''an irreconcilable discrepancy'' between the testimony of Mr. Harden and Mr. Herring over whether Mr. Harden had been receptive to the scheme allegedly proposed by Vesaco intermediaries.\n\nPresident Reagan's Attorney General, William French Smith, has called for repeal of the special prosecutor law, saying that it has ''severe constitutional problems'' because it treats public officials more harshly than other citizens. In the Vesco case Justice Department officials said that the law provided a useful alternative in handling a politically sensitive case.\n\nMr. Heymann and Mr. Henderson both said in 1979 memorandums that a special prosecutor would have helped the department avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Robert L.

        "instruction": "KABUL—Potential fraud has become a key theme of Afghanistan's presidential race, with two of the three main contenders warning against attempts to rig the April 5 vote to benefit President Hamid Karzai's favored candidate, who firmly rejected such accusations.\n\nAn election perceived as stolen could plunge the country into fresh conflict just as U.S.-led international forces withdraw, foreign aid shrinks and Taliban attacks persist.\n\nAll of the main candidates say they want to sign a security agreement with the U.S.—which Mr. Karzai has blocked—that would allow some American forces to remain after December. Turmoil over a disputed election, however, could disrupt those plans, too.\n\nWhile Kabul officials deny bias or plans to stuff ballot boxes, the possibility that the election's legitimacy will be thrown into doubt is increasingly worrying the U.S. and allied governments that have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on Afghanistan since 2001.\n\n\"The responsibility of the candidates is extremely important. If Afghanistan, God forbid, will be destabilized again, nobody will be a winner,\" former Foreign Minister Zalmai Rassoul, seen as Mr. Karzai's presidential pick, said in a Wall Street Journal interview.\n\n\"The worst scenario would be that the election will not go well,\" he said. \"The Afghan people will lose all the trust in the democratic process and we will go back to square one—instead of the ballot box, the people will use their Kalashnikovs to take power.\"\n\nMr. Karzai's re-election in 2009 was marred by massive falsification; roughly a million ballots cast on his behalf were disqualified by the country's electoral watchdog. Some of the worst fraud occurred in the perilous areas of the country's south and east, where Taliban threats kept voters away from the polls, and local officials simply stuffed the ballot boxes, said witnesses and election observers.\n\nWith the security situation more precarious now, many Afghans are concerned about more-brazen rigging—especially because the electoral watchdog, which in 2009 was dominated by international representatives, is now made up of Mr. Karzai's appointees.\n\nUnder Afghan law, if no candidate wins an outright majority on April 5, the two top vote-getters will contest a runoff election, likely in June.\n\nThough there are no reliable polls in Afghanistan, the three contenders with the most active campaigns and widest support are former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, who finished second to Mr. Karzai in 2009; former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani ; and Mr. Rassoul—a late entrant perceived as lagging behind the two others.\n\n\"The way he is doing so far, [Rassoul] will not be one of the first two—unless there is another way, using the government network and, through that, stuffing the boxes,\" said Nader Nadery, chairman of the Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan, which aims to deploy some 10,000 observers on Election Day. \"And if that's the case, you will unfortunately have a situation where the other two may not accept the first-round result, and the contested first-round result will prolong a political crisis.\"\n\nMr. Nadery clarified on Monday that his opinion about Mr. Rassoul's standing in the race wasn't based on FEFA's observation, and that \"perceptions can change or further strengthen\" as the campaign develops. He has also warned that the possibility of fraud exists in all the camps. \"This time, we have to watch all the major [candidates],\" he said.\n\nAnother candidate, former Islamist warlord Abdul Rasoul Sayyaf, is also seen as able to secure a significant number of votes, though he currently appears unlikely to make it into the runoff. Former Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak, initially seen as an important candidate, abandoned the race Sunday without offering to back any of his former opponents.\n\nMr. Karzai hasn't openly endorsed Mr. Rassoul. But he did publicly prod his older brother, Qayum, to withdraw from the race this month. Though Qayum joined the Rassoul team as a result, Mr. Rassoul's aides acknowledge that he still trails Messrs. Abdullah and Ghani.\n\nWhile Messrs. Abdullah and Ghani have been readying their presidential bids for years, Mr. Rassoul said that until a few months ago he had expected to retire and play golf.\n\n\"My electoral infrastructure was weaker than of the others because my colleague candidates were planning for a long time,\" Mr. Rassoul said. \"I believe that my team is in the top three.\"\n\nMr. Rassoul said that he doesn't want to be elected through fraud, and that he believes he will gain momentum with a series of rallies across the country in coming weeks. Events this weekend in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand drew tens of thousands of voters.\n\nMr. Rassoul's vice-presidential candidate, Habiba Sarabi, said, \"We can catch up very soon. The next two weeks we will push a lot.\"\n\nBut it will be a challenge to fight off the perception—fueled by Mr. Rassoul's rivals—that he is incapable of gathering enough honest votes by April 5 to make it into the runoff.\n\n\"Perhaps, that camp, its main hope is on the fraud,\" Mr. Abdullah said in an interview. \"Anybody who is laying his hopes on the fraud is making a huge mistake. Not only it is not going to work, in the democratic system this is the biggest damage to the foundation of the system. It will not be acceptable to the people. That I know.\"\n\nMr. Ghani voiced a similar warning. \"We have a very different level of public awareness of fraud, and the public will not tolerate fraud,\" he said in an interview. \"The days when we had a silent majority in this country are over.\"\n\nWestern diplomats and Afghan officials said Mr. Karzai, who intends to remain in Kabul after the election, aims to remain influential should Mr. Rassoul win the presidency. His authority would likely be weaker if Mr. Ghani or—especially—Mr. Abdullah, came to power.\n\nIn a speech to Parliament Saturday, Mr. Karzai pledged that the election will be free and warned the West against trying to influence its outcome.\n\nHe also dismissed concerns that the government machinery is being used to help Mr. Rassoul.\n\n\"Our government is very weak, and cannot do it,\" Mr. Karzai said. \"Or if it is done, it is in favor of all the candidates. All the candidates have someone in the government.\"\n\nIn fact, while the preponderance of official support seems to be behind Mr. Rassoul, Mr. Ghani also has influential backers, such as the current minister of finance. Mr. Abdullah's allies include the powerful governor of the northern Balkh province.\n\n\"Dr. Ashraf Ghani is as close to the president as I am,\" Mr. Rassoul said. \"I don't have government institutions in my hand. I am a democrat. My aim is not to win at any cost: Anybody who wins by fraud cannot keep this country stable.\"\n\n—Matt Murray and Nathan Hodge contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com and Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.com",

        "instruction": "TWO years before the Declaration of Independence, in 1774, a New York confectioner - last name Lenzi, first name unknown - helped set off a revolution of another kind: he announced that his store would be selling ice cream. Since then, ice-cream parlors have experienced boom and bust, but the species endures. Snuggling up with a pint in front of the video-cassette recorder has its pleasures, but many people prefer to sip their sodas in public, on a stool, with the ineffable smell of chocolate and happiness.\n\nNaturally, the species has had to adapt. It sells sandwiches. It accepts heresies such as mashed-up cookies. It even goes in for aberrations, including a concoction called Astronaut (freeze-dried ice-cream crystals). But in essence the ice-cream parlor remains what it always was, a monument to decadence, languor and the insatiable American sweet tooth.\n\nThere are two broad categories of ice-cream parlors: old and new. In New York, most of the classic survivors, with their dark wooden interiors and cool marble countertops, can be found outside Manhattan, in sleepy corners of the Bronx, on busy boulevards in Queens, on residential avenues in Brooklyn where a trip to the ice-cream parlor is still a summer rite. Some are first-generation, but most are second- and third-generation businesses whose original owners long ago retired or died.\n\nFew are as elegant as they were in their heyday, circa 1945, before home air-conditioners and freezers rendered ice-cream parlors obsolete. But compared with any of the eat-and-run chains, they are rich in history and mood. Some are sad places, too, with an aura of having-been.\n\nThe newer parlors cluster in Manhattan. Their styles tend to be imitative, but a few innovators have brightened the scene, producing ice-cream parlors that are provocative to both eye and palate. Ice-cream concoctions in these establishments tend to be bigger, richer and more awesome than the norm on the theory that the richest fudge, the richest ice cream and the richest whipped cream make the best sundae; it is a theory that more modest old-fashioned establishments disprove. In either incarnation, ice-cream parlors today are vastly different from what they were in the mid-1800's, when they were a way of life, especially for ladies. ''After a hard hour's shopping at Stewart's,'' - A. T. Stewart was a fashionable New York store - ''most of his crinolined patrons found themselves in need of a little resuscitation at Taylor's and Thompson's gilded ice-cream saloons directly across the street,'' Michael and Ariane Batterberry write in ''On the Town in New York, From 1776 to the Present'' (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973). Ice-cream parlors were among the few places women could dine unaccompanied without causing a scandal.\n\nMany of the established parlors were owned by Germans. Names like Karp, Blohm and Schmidt were synonymous with the pleasures of hand-dipped chocolate and ice cream made fresh each day. Asked why, Hannelore Kohler, a native of Oldenburg, West Germany, who works for the German Information Center in New York, said, ''Personally, I don't know. In Germany, all the ice-cream parlors are run by Italians.''\n\nKathleen Neils Conzen, an associate professor of history at the University of Chicago who has studied America's German immigrants, said, ''In the mid-19th century, Germans introduced to New York the boulevard and cafe life of Europe.'' The ice-cream parlor, she said, may have been an indoor version of the German beer garden.\n\nIn the 20th century, freezer technology made ice cream easier to obtain. Soon, the ice-cream parlor was a charming anachronism, no longer a mandatory stop after a matinee or Saturday night date. Soon after that, the matinee and Saturday night date became charming anachronisms. James P. Hurley, an associate archivist of the New York City Municipal Archives, said that since 1970, their numbers have plummeted. William Schafer, secretary of the Confectioners' and Ice Cream Manufacturers' Association of the State of New York, said there are probably only 50 ice-cream parlors in the city.\n\nOne of the dowagers, Hinck of Brooklyn, on Fulton Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, closed its doors in 1971. Henry Hinck, who with his brother, William, ran the store, continued to occupy the premises. On occasion, he could be seen wandering through the ice-cream parlor, which was housed in a stately brownstone. He was beaten during a break-in not long afterward and died in a few weeks.\n\nThe wondrous interior with its mahogany back bars and nine-foot beveled mirrors caught the attention of a curator from Albany, who considered transplanting it, booth by booth, to the New York State Museum, where it would reside next to other relics, including a subway car from a 1940's A train and a barbershop from the Upper West Side. Instead, John Logue Sr. and his sons bought the interior for $20,000 and installed it in one of their parlors.\n\nThere are easier ways to earn a living than running an ice-cream parlor, another reason for their decline. ''Who wants to work so hard?'' asked Mr. Logue, owner of Hinsch's in Brooklyn and a former president of the ice-cream manufacturers' association.\n\nIn 1963, there were more than 400 members. Now there are 56. Owners complain of rising rents and electric bills. ''That means your first 75 ice-cream cones a day go to pay off your electric bill,'' said John Logue Jr., a co-owner of Once Upon a Sundae in Brooklyn. ''If you're going to invest $400,000 to open a business, why not open a restaurant where the average check is $20, not $2.50?''\n\nWhat is remarkable, then, is not how few ice-cream parlors exist but that any exist at all, and that the quality of the product has improved. Most of the ice-cream parlors sampled get high marks. Homemade ice cream has become so ubiquitous that owners are embarrassed to admit they use a commercial brand, even when that brand is perfectly acceptable. In some cases, owners refuse to specify the brand, except to say a manufacturer ''makes it specially for us.'' Questions about some of the best sundaes evoked this response.\n\nAll parlor owners make their own whipped cream, or claim to, and yet the quality of whipped cream varied enormously. At one parlor, the whipped cream was so delicious that it was sold ''to go'' by its airy self.\n\nThe maraschino cherry has made a comeback, if this study of ice-cream parlors is any indication. An exception is Hoft's Luncheonette in the Bronx, famed for crowning its sundaes with a rich burgundy cherry in syrup. Supply problems will keep it off the menu until November.\n\nWhat really distinguishes parlors is their atmosphere, and therein lies the difference between a sundae that satisfies the palate and one that satisfies the soul.\n\nRanging from classical to new-fangled, here is the spectrum. At each, various dishes were sampled, but for the sake of consistency and tradition, a banana split was always tried.\n\nPhotos of Eddie's Sweet Shop in Forest Hills and assorted ice-cream eaters (NYT/Alan Zale); Photos of John Logue Jr. making vanilla ice-cream soda and various ice-cream treats (NYT/Alan Zale) (Pg. 6)",

Helen Lane agreed to translate small sections of the book when she could steal time from better paying projects. Ernesto Sabato agreed to offer consultation when needed, and to go on waiting; Mr. Godine agreed to publish the book no matter how long it might take to complete the translations; and the Center agreed to pay Helen Lane for those translated snippets with proportionally small sums filched from other sources, such as the budget for office supplies. The paper clip fund we called it.\n\nNeedless to say, the task was long in the doing and slow in the paying - so delayed, in fact, that the translation was finished well after I left the Center, whose Literature Program, I understand, eventually allocated most of one year's reduced budget to the final payment.\n\nNone of this information, of course, belongs to a review of Ernesto Sabato's novel; it does belong to the continuing history of ignored translators. And that history continues to mean the withholding and postponement of foreign books from their audience in this country.\n\nMr. Coover has done much over a long span of time to recognize Latin American literature. The Times, however, has failed to insist, as a matter of editorial policy, that its writers review the author we read in English - namely, the translator - as well as the author whose work that translator makes available to us. Each time the Book Review fails in this responsibility, it contributes to the economic pressure and literary neglect that make translating, all too often, an unrewarded struggle.

''The great Mayor Fiorello La Guardia commented on this when he said, 'There is no Republican way or Democratic way to clean the streets,' '' Mr. Koch said. ''And now that the city can afford it, I am saying we'll do our best to make the streets cleaner.''\n\nMr. Koch got 233 of the 317 committee members, but the four rows of Queens seats in the Terrace Ballroom of the Roosevelt Hotel were empty as Republican leaders voted to let the Democratic Mr. Koch run in their party's primary.\n\nHis friends say that one reason Mr. Koch wants the Republican line is to outdo Mr. La Guardia, whose support never included the two major parties. Backing Called 'Intolerable'\n\nQueens has its own candidate, Assemblyman John S. Esposito, and the county leader, Jack R.

Mr. Muratori said Queens might sue to upset the vote.\n\nThe Staten Island leader, George Hart, praised Mr. Koch's ''feisty spirit'' and moved to extend the invitation to the Mayor, whom he described as ''a true Republican.''\n\nState Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan chairman and the host at the meeting of Republican leaders, said that in endorsing Mr. Koch for a second four-year term, his party was ''putting the welfare of seven million New Yorkers above partisan politics.''\n\nThe Republicans were also acknowledging the Mayor's promises to help them with fund-raising and to heed their recommendations on jobs.\n\nAnd they were trying to protect candidates lower down on the voting machines from slippage that could be suffered without the name of Mr. Koch at the top.\n\nThe session conferred official designation on the Mayor's two Republican running mates - Richard A. Bernstein, a Manhattan realestate man, for City Comptroller, and Guy J. Velella, an Assemblyman from the Bronx, for president of the City Council.\n\nThere had been two declared mayoral Republican candidates, but Bernard Rome pulled out yesterday and accused the Mayor of buying Republican support with promises of jobs and judgeships.\n\nMr. Rome said he wanted Mr. Esposito to win ''because no Mayor should have a two-party endorsement, particularly one that he didn't earn but that he bought.''\n\nNo matter what Republican voters decide in the primary on Sept. 10, Mr. Esposito will run in November as the Conservative Party's mayoral candidate.\n\nMr. Koch must win in September to get the Republican nomination. The Liberals picked Mary T. Codd, a Staten Island City Council member. For the Democratic nomination, Mr. Koch is being challenged by Assemblyman Frank J.

Still, the information can be enough to scuttle a job candidate’s chances.\n\nSome of the employees, who submit written statements after being questioned by store security officers, have no idea that they are admitting committing a theft or that the information will remain in databases, according to interviews with consumer lawyers, regulators, and employees.\n\nThe databases, which have tens of thousands of subscribers and are used by major retailers like Target, CVS, and Family Dollar, are aimed at combating employee theft, which accounts for a large swath of missing merchandise. The latest figures available, from 2011, put the loss at about 44 percent of missing merchandise, valued at about $15 billion, according to a trade group, the National Retail Federation.\n\nRetailers ‘‘don’t want to take a chance on hiring somebody that they might have a problem with,’’ said Richard Mellor, the federation’s vice president for loss prevention.\n\nBut the databases, which are legal, are facing scrutiny from labor lawyers and federal regulators, who worry they are so sweeping that innocent employees can be harmed. The lawyers say workers are often coerced into confessing, sometimes when they have done nothing wrong, without understanding that they will be branded as thieves.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has fielded complaints about the databases and is examining whether they comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law aimed at curbing inaccurate consumer information and giving consumers more control, said Anthony Rodriguez, a staff lawyer at the agency.\n\nLexisNexis agreed last week to pay $13.5 million to settle a class action on behalf of 31,000 people that accused the firm of violating consumer protection laws by selling background checks to debt collectors. The company did not admit wrongdoing.\n\nSince the recession, lawsuits have proliferated against the companies that operate retail theft databases, like LexisNexis, which owned Esteem until this year, HireRight and GIS, according to a review of court records. In the past year, the nature of the lawsuits has changed, too, as lawyers try to build class-action cases. HireRight did not return calls for comment, and the other firms declined to comment.\n\nSome retailers are moving away from the databases. Home Depot, which just stopped using Esteem, said the decision followed a general review of ‘‘systems and services.’’\n\nFor Keesha Goode, $34.97 in missing merchandise was enough to destroy her future in retailing.\n\nGoode, 28, was a clerk at the discount store Forman Mills in 2008 when she was accused of not ringing up a former employee’s purchases. Goode, who maintains her innocence, said she had agreed to write out a statement because she worried she would be sent to jail.\n\nShe received a letter from Dollar General alerting her that she had been turned down for a job partly because of her listing in Esteem, and a copy of the report showed that she had a ‘‘verified admission’’ for ‘‘theft of merchandise.’’\n\nShe wrote LexisNexis, ‘‘I was accused of not reporting on a former employee who was stealing merchandise, but I did not steal anything myself.’’\n\nThe company responded that it had reinvestigated and ‘‘verified’’ the accuracy of the information. Goode, has a lawsuit pending against LexisNexis, accusing the company of violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, March 3— The Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, threw his support today behind a Republican move to commit the committee and Congress to an early effective date for tax relief for business.\n\nRepresentative Barber B. Conable Jr., the ranking Republican on Ways and Means, had proposed as an effective date Jan. 1, 1981 or possibly Feb. 18, the day on which President Reagan outlined his tax and budget proposals in a speech to Congress.\n\nMr. Rostenkowski's willingness to cooperate with Mr. Conable was seen as politically significant because the Ways and Means chairman is understood to be interested in forging a consensus with the Republicans on a bipartisan bill. The chairman's assent seemed to make it certain that the depreciation provision would be retroactive, probably to Jan. 1.\n\nMr. Conable said he told Mr. Rostenkowski at the start of a hearing this morning that business needed reassurances about tax relief so that planned investment would not be delayed. Mr. Rostenkowski's support of the Jan. 1 effective date was his first public statement on Mr. Reagan's tax proposals for business. Democratic Support\n\nMr. Reagan has proposed a sweeping liberalization of tax writeoffs for depreciation of equipment, vehicles and buildings, retroactive to Jan. 1. The proposal has broad business support and Democrats have said that it will be enacted substantially as proposed.\n\nPrivately, Democrats said that Mr. Reagan commands much public support and they are fearful of opposing him outright, or even too effectively. ''We don't want to be holding the bag if the whole Reagan package comes apart,'' one Ways and Means Democrat said. Another Democratic source close to the committee said a purely Democratic tax bill ''might not insure to the benefit of the Democratic party.''\n\nIn questioning today of Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, committee Democrats signaled repeatedly their unwillingness to deliver in a single bill the three consecutive years of income tax rate reduction for individuals proposed by Mr. Reagan.\n\nMr. Volcker gave them quiet encouragement. He passed up several opportunities to say unequivocally that a three-year bill reducing income taxes by 30 percent was a good idea. Instead, he elaborated on the position he has taken before other committees, that Congress's first order of business should be enacting every last dollar of Mr. Reagan's proposed spending cuts.\n\n''I wouldn't be disappointed if you went beyond the Reagan spending cuts,'' Mr. Volcker said. In a typical Democratic comment, Representative James M. Shannon of Massachusetts said he was troubled by the fact that Congress deals with spending one year at a time and was being asked to commit itself for three years on taxes. 'Some Concerns'\n\n''I have some concerns'' about that also, Mr. Volcker said. Mr. Rostenkowski returned to this theme as the three-hour hearing ended. ''To take us out completely from any management of tax policy for three years gives me a great deal of concern,'' he said.\n\nReflecting the doubts about the Republican Administration's favorable economic forecasts expressed by many Democrats, Mr. Rostenkowski characterized the Reagan tax policy as ''an apple-piein-the-sky operation.''\n\nMr. Volcker steered clear of giving the committee specific advice on the details of a tax bill, saying that was not the province of the Federal Reserve. But when pressed, he criticized proposed relief of the so-called marriage penalty as lacking ''incentive effect'' and making no contribution to productivity.\n\nMr. Volcker made the following other remarks:\n\n- Congressional action to prohibit deductions for interest on consumer debt would help to fight inflation. It is generally agreed there is no prospect such legislation will be passed this year.\n\n- Industrial development bonds should continue to be ''a tax loophole for investment.'' Because the interest paid to bondholders is exempt from Federal income tax, the bonds can be sold by state and local authorities at relatively low cost to the borrower, which means low-cost money for the industrial investment.\n\n- Congress should put limits on lending by the Federal Financing Bank and not ''leave it open-ended.'' The bank, an arm of the Treasury, has been criticized as a backdoor financing vehicle for Federal programs, including some that by law are outside the formal budget.\n\nIn another development that could slow the progress of the tax bill, the office of Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas and chairman of the Finance Committee, reported that his complete recovery from five hours of surgery for removal of a kidney stone might take several months. An aide said Mr. Dole would work as much as he could on the tax bill but that Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the second-ranking Republican, might have to serve as chairman of the proceedings.",

A prolonged lack of negotiations, in itself, China warned, could provoke a military attack.\n\nThe Chinese have long made it clear that any moves by Taiwan toward formal independence would lead to war. But today's government report on Taiwan adds -- for the first time in such a definitive policy statement -- that if Taiwan refuses indefinitely to pursue ''the peaceful settlement of cross-straits reunification through negotiations, then the Chinese government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force, to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.''\n\nThe report does not provide timetable or deadline for negotiating progress. Still, ''This is a signal that Beijing is getting impatient with the delays in the process of reunification,'' said Andrew Yang, secretary general of the China Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a private group in Taipei. ''This is a warning to the people of Taiwan.''\n\nTaiwan officials said they would not comment until they had studied the document. As of tonight, the candidates in the March 18 presidential elections had not responded. The top contenders have favored talks of some sort, but not Beijing's vision of reunification.\n\nThe 11,000-word report, entitled ''The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue,'' was released by the Taiwan affairs office and the information office of the state council, China's cabinet.\n\nIt elaborates on China's longstanding proposal for a negotiated return of Taiwan under a version of the ''one country, two systems'' formula, with even greater autonomy than was given to Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. ''Provided that it is within the framework of one China, any question can be discussed,'' the report says, including ''Taiwan's international space for economic, cultural and social activities compatible with its status, the political status of the Taiwan authorities and other questions.''\n\nThat formula has been rejected as too confining by Taiwan's leaders and the three leading presidential candidates.\n\nThe dire warnings in the document were a reminder of what an emotional issue the reunification of Taiwan with the ''motherland'' is for Beijing, especially now that Hong Kong and Macao have returned to the fold. While there was no ultimatum or threat of immediate attack, they also underscore how explosive the confrontation across the Taiwan Strait is, potentially drawing the United States into war with China.\n\nToday's report lambastes the United States for providing advanced weapons to Taiwan, which China says violates promises, and for proposals in Congress for a closer military relationship with the island, which it calls a ''gross interference in China's internal affairs and a grave threat to China's security.''\n\nThe United States officially supports the concept of ''one China,'' but is also committed to providing Taiwan with the means to defend itself against attack.\n\nIn Washington, the State Department said there would be no official response until the report was studied ''very carefully.'' But the harder line on Taiwan was likely to cause political problems for the Clinton administration as it faces a battle for Congressional approval of to get China's membership in the World Trade Organization approved in Congress. And the report's denunciation of the Congressional bill to upgrade military ties with Taiwan, which passed the House this month, could enhance support for the bill in the Senate.\n\nThe new Chinese report bitterly condemns Taiwan's president, Lee Tung-hui, accusing him of destroying previous talks with his assertion last summer that Taiwan would negotiate with China only on a ''state-to-state'' basis and his refusal to repeat the traditional homage to the concept of ''one China.''\n\nAfter Mr. Lee's statement last summer, China broke off planned high-level meetings, charging that Mr. Lee was secretly scheming for independence even though he professes to support reunion at some distant point -- after the mainland, too, has become a democracy.\n\nThe report condemns Mr. Lee's suggestion of waiting for democracy as ''an excuse for postponing and resisting reunification,'' since China has offered to allow different political systems to coexist under the banner of one China.\n\nIt is too early to tell what effect China's sharp words might have on Taiwan's election campaign. In 1996, before Taiwan's first direct elections for president, China was angered by Mr. Lee's defiant statements and fired missiles near Taiwan as a warning. The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region.\n\nMr. Lee won election handily and seemed to gain popular appeal though his brinkmanship, but since then many Taiwanese who had toyed with the idea of declaring independence have had second thoughts.\n\nChina lacks the military power to invade Taiwan, experts say, and is no match for American forces should they be drawn into a confrontation. But China is steadily improving its navy; it recently received the first of two Russian-built guided-missile destroyers designed to penetrate American carrier group defenses. And it is building up forces of ballistic and cruise missiles. Both could be used to cripple Taiwan's economy by disrupting sea lanes.\n\nSo far, this year's election campaign has involved fewer military tensions, and in Taiwan the candidates have gone out of their way to avoid sounding provocative. Surveys show that a large majority of the Taiwan public, after enjoying years of prosperity and democracy, does not want a military confrontation with China.\n\nAll three major candidates, -- Vice President Lien Chan of the governing Nationalist Party; James Soong, a former Nationalist leader who is running as an independent, and Chen Shui-bian, of the Democratic Progressive Party -- have made vague pledges to resume negotiations of some sort with China and to encourage more trade and business links. But none endorses China's formula for reunification, and it is unclear what the two sides might say in future to talks to give China a sense of progress toward unity.\n\nSome political experts think that today's Chinese warning may be intended, in part, to scare voters away from Mr. Chen, whose party has long been associated with Taiwan independence. The founding charter of his party calls for a referendum on whether the island, still formally called the Republic of China, should be renamed the Republic of Taiwan.\n\nMr. Chen, seeking to broaden his electoral appeal, has declared that since Taiwan is already independent in practice, it does not need a formal declaration and that if elected, he would not pursue a referendum on the issue unless Taiwan came under attack. He has offered to discuss improving communications and economic ties, something the mainland badly wants.\n\nThe report released today unequivocally rejects the legitimacy of any referendum in Taiwan on independence, warning, ''Any attempt to separate Taiwan from China through so-called referendum would only lead the Taiwan people to disaster.''\n\nIn effect, today's warning puts the Taiwan candidates on notice that China does not intend to allow a repeat of Mr. Lee's performance, which it believes brought a halt to even the pretense of negotiations toward symbolic unification.\n\nPhoto: Policy toward Beijing dominates Taiwan's presidential campaign, with leading candidates avoiding provocative remarks.

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON THE international trade negotiating agenda for 1981 and beyond is likely to be dominated by American demands for greater access to world markets where it has a competitive edge even as it seeks to protect some of its less competitive traditional manufacturing industries.\n\nWhile the world's trading giant seeks more markets for its agricultural, high-technology and service industries, it likely will be establishing greater barriers against automobile, steel and apparel imports from other industrial as well as developing countries.\n\nInternational trade has become increasingly important for the United States, which once stood largely aloof from world markets. During the decade of the 1970's, exports grew rapidly, from 4.3 percent of the gross national product in 1970 to 8 percent in 1980.\n\nExports now account for 20 percent of domestic goods production, one out of every seven American manufacturing jobs and, including return on investment overseas, $1 out of every $3 earned by American corporations.\n\nAs United States companies began to embrace export business, they integrated their production processes throughout the world. Today, the so-called European Airbus is one-third American-made, RCA produces television sets in Taiwan, Zenith makes them in Mexico, and some Chrysler cars use engines made by Volkswagen in West Germany and by Mitsubishi in Japan.\n\nAgainst these dramatic changes - which now blur the old distinctions between free trade and protectionism - domestic policy issues are seen increasingly in international terms.\n\n''Successful management of the U.S. economy will require successful management of the global economy,'' Robert D. Hormats, Deputy United States Trade Representative in the Carter Administration, said.\n\nOne early bit of business for the new Congress will be the demand for protection by the auto industry, which has lost a huge share of the domestic market to Japanese imports while it retools to produce smaller, fuel-efficient cars.\n\nBill Brock, the new Unitd States Trade Representative, has served notice that he will take a hard line in negotiations with the Japanese aimed at trimming their huge trade surpluses with this country.\n\n''They have been living in a very protected environment for a long time,'' he told his Senate confirmation hearing, and ''have had almost total free access to the American market.''\n\nHe added that ''if they want access to our market, by golly, they'll have to allow us access to theirs.'' Another issue due for discussion this year will involve apparel imports. Negotiations are already underway in Geneva over a new Multi-Fiber Arrangement, under which shipments from developing countries are controlled by international quotas.\n\nTextile and apparel manufacturers in Western Europe and the United States have been putting strong pressure on their governments to sharply reduce access by third world suppliers, mainly the advanced developing countries, such as Taiwan, Korea and Singapore.\n\nBut also on the agenda, though not necessarily for 1981, is a new round of negotiations to liberalize trade in services and remove some of the trade-distorting effects of investment incentives and the performance requirements that are imposed upon foreign investors by host governments.\n\nThe latter is a particularly pronounced in many developing countries. Mexico, for example, refuses to permit sale of any automobiles that are not assembled within its borders.\n\n''The time has come to create a GATT for investment,'' C. Fred Bergsten, Assistant Secretary of Treasury in the Carter Administration, said, referring to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade governing world commerce in goods.\n\nLiberalization of trade in services is getting increasing attention in Washington. It is seen as an essential accompaniment to the export of advanced technology, a particularly stong export area for the United States and one that requires the sale of training, management and repair services along with hardware.\n\nExports of United States products requiring intensive research and development accounted for two-thirds of export sales of manufactured goods in 1979 and generated a surplus in that year of more than $39 billiion. The United States is also a strong competitor in the export of design and construction services, but the most dynamic export sector is agriculture.\n\nIn the 1970's, the value of agricultural exports grew at an average annual rate of 19 percent, compared with an agricultural import growth rate of 12.6 percent. The result was an increase in the agricultural trade surplus from $1.5 billion in 1970 to $18.3 billion in 1979, and the export of United States farm products is expected to play a major role in the years ahead, as a growing world population requires increased food supplies.\n\nSuch globalization of economic issues has both increased their complexity and presented new challenges for the United States. Third world countries, for example, which have been the fastestgrowing market for American exports, are now rapidly developing their own industrial base and are competing increasingly in the traditional manufacturing sectors such as steel, automotive equipment, metalworking, rubber, apparel and footwear.\n\nAnother challenge relates to the pressures to secure sources of energy, food and scarce raw materials - pressures that could well cause new trade frictions.\n\nA report entitled Global 2000, published in mid-1980 by the State Department and the Council on Environmental Quality, said that, on the basis of current trends, there will not only be great increases in global population in the near future, but wider income disparities among and within nations, major gaps between supply and demand for food and energy and rapid depletion of forests and arable land.\n\nAgainst these harsh projections comes growing intervention of governments in the conduct of trade, intensifying the need to develop rules of fair play stretching well beyond tariffs and quotas to the almost limitless expanse of non-tariff barriers.\n\nA start was made in the so-called Tokyo Round of trade talks, which set up codes and agreements strengthening the authority of the Geneva-based Council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to deal with trade violations.\n\nBut these new rules and the dispute-settlement procedures that were also set up have yet to be tested. Moreover, there are significant gaps in their coverage. They do not, for example, deal with trade in services. Also ignored is the sometimes fierce bidding that goes on among nations and even states of the United States to lure plant investment by multinational companies.\n\nWhatever the outcome of current negotiations may be, however, it has become clear that, as rich and poor nations become more closely linked through common problems, the establishment of a unified system of trade would be a firm step toward finding proper solutions.

Sleek and stunning, yes, but not likely to spark the next iRevolution. The tech giant’s bigger strategic bet is that mobile pay service Apple Pay, debuting Monday, will be the next thing you didn’t know you needed — but now can’t live without.\n\nThe new iPads should sell well during the upcoming holiday shopping season, even as the worldwide tablet market is showing signs of slowing growth, analysts said. But they’re not the kind of game-changing new product that has made Apple a darling of Silicon Valley and the tech industry’s most valuable company.\n\nInstead, the industry will be watching closely to see how consumers react to Apple Pay, which chief executive Tim Cook said will go live next week. Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett says the service is hugely important because it puts Apple in the middle of a wide range of consumer transactions. That underscores Apple’s value as a brand and gives people a powerful new reason to buy iPhones, iPads, and other gadgets.\n\n‘‘It’s a strategic advance not just because it may be a new revenue source, but because it injects Apple into a whole different value stream’’ for customers and the company’s business partners, Gillett says.\n\nThat’s regardless of whether Apple Pay generates direct revenue: Apple has said it won’t charge consumers or merchants for using it, but some experts think banks will share a small slice of the fee they normally collect on each credit card transaction.\n\nApple unveiled a thinner iPad Thursday with a faster processor and a better camera.\n\nMobile pay isn’t new; rival tech companies and the banking industry have worked on such systems for years. But Apple is launching its service at an ideal time, says Gartner tech analyst Van Baker. Consumers are increasingly worried about the security of traditional credit and debit cards and US merchants are facing new mandates to switch to safer chip-based cards or other payment systems.\n\n‘‘Consumers are going to have to learn a new way to pay,’’ Baker says. ‘‘That levels the playing field for new technology.’’\n\nAssuming there are no system breakdowns or security flaws, Apple will get the benefit of pioneering a mobile payment system that has widespread brand recognition.\n\nAs for the new iPads revealed Thursday, analysts praised their technical features, including faster processors, better cameras, and Touch ID, which lets users unlock the device with a fingerprint.",

        "instruction": "LOS ANGELES, July 28— President Reagan opened the Games of the XXIII Olympiad tonight with a brief formal declaration, then minutes later pronounced the Soviet Union the ''losers'' for having boycotted the games.\n\nIn a television interview after the opening, the President said it would be ''far better for the world'' if the Soviets had attended.\n\n''I think they're the losers,'' he said.\n\nThe comment was offered minutes after the President formally opened the games with a slightly edited version of the official declaration.\n\nIn the 17-word version offered by Mr. Reagan amid a panoply of athletes on the field of the Coliseum, he declared: ''Celebrating the Twenty-third Olympiad of the modern era, I declare open the Olympic Games of Los Angeles.''\n\nWhite House officials said the statement was not erroroneous and had been cleared with Olympic officials.\n\nThe President watched the opening ceremonies from a glass-enclosed booth atop the Coliseum and exclaimed, according to the White House press office, such things as: ''Out of this world, but only in America!'' The White House said Mr. Reagan tapped his foot throughout an elaborate, crowded and long entertainment spectacle that, from afar, resembled a musical Breughel.\n\nEarlier in the day, the President took on the role of Cheerleader in Chief as he exhorted the United States Olympic team to win some gold ''for the Gipper.''\n\n''So, set your sights high,'' he told the team during a visit to the Olympic Village at the University of Southern California. ''And go for it!''\n\n''When you see us in the stands waving Old Glory,'' the President told the athletes, ''you know that we're waving it for you.''\n\nFour years ago as a candidate for President, Mr. Reagan caused some controversy with what critics considered a proposal to cancel the 1984 Games here. Mr. Reagan had talked of insulating the Olympics from politics by situating them permanently in Greece. He did so in reacting to the position of his election opponent, President Carter, who had declared a boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nToday, however, President Reagan happily assumed the role of national host in welcoming the world's athletes to the Games and in cheering on the home-team competitors. In that speech, he made no mention of international politics nor of the Soviet Union's decision this year to retaliate and boycott the Los Angeles Games.\n\n''You will be competing against athletes from many nations,'' he told them, ''But, most important, you are competing against yourself. All we expect is for you to do your very best, to push yourself just one more fraction of a second, one notch higher, one inch further.''\n\n''Each time you do that, you've created a magic moment of beauty and excellence in which all of us will share,'' the President said,\n\nMr. Reagan, whose aides denied that he had any intent to add politics to the roster of Olympic events, told the American team that ''there is a new patriotism spreading across our country.'' This echoed one of the themes of his re-election campaign, a theme that was repeated on the President's paid political radio broadcast today as Mr. Reagan praised the nation's youth. In hailing the Olympics in the broadcast, the President also spoke of ''New Patriotism'' and said that lately he could discern a new optimism and ''affection for the nation'' in the music of the young.\n\nHis own marathon event, the Presidential election, was alluded to when Mr. Reagan was asked as he toured the Olympic Village grounds whether he felt like a winner. ''No,'' the President replied, smiling. ''But I feel like I'm surrounded by winners. If it rubs off, then I'm a winner.''\n\nMr. Reagan visted the American team several hours before formally opening the Games of the XXIII Olympiad. He told the Americans of his own days as a college athlete when coaches would attempt ''some punchy phrases'' to motivate the team. ''Looking back now, I know those coaches were as excited at the time as we were,'' said the President, a former football lineman and sports announcer.\n\nHe then called for a superior effort, invoking the name of ''the Gipper'' - George Gipp, the Notre Dame football legend whom Mr. Reagan portrayed in the movies. This time Mr. Reagan chose to play more the role of Knute Rockne, Gipp's coach, who was famous for his lockerroom speech that used the sudden death of Gipp as a spark to victory.\n\n''Go for it!'' Mr. Reagan told the 600 American Olympians. ''For yourselves, for your families, for your country. And, you can forgive me if I'm a little presumptuous, do it for the Gipper.''\n\nHe said he spoke for all Americans in declaring: ''You are our team. And each and every one of us is with you 100 percent.''\n\nHe added that, ''We'll be cheering, win, lose or draw.'' Enthusiastic Reponse\n\nLOS ANGELES, July 28 (AP) - The American athletes reacted enthusiastically to President Reagan's remarks today.\n\nThe team, standing in the hot sun on a cement walkway in front of the U.S.C. Athletic Department headquarters, had Bob Djokovich, the captain of the team handball squad, present Reagan a boxed set of United States Olympic team pins.\n\nThey greeted the president by chanting ''U.S.A., U.S.A.'' and many athletes jumped on their teammates' shoulders for a better view.\n\n''It was great. He's excited and I'm excited too, '' said the wrestler Frank Famiano.\n\n''I'm glad he didn't mention the re- election campaign and that he focused on the Olympics,'' said the 10,000-meter runner Craig Virgin.

        "instruction": "HOLLYWOOD, Sept. 22— Twenty-five years ago Al Pacino was walking down Sunset Boulevard with some friends when he passed a revival theater showing ''Scarface,'' the 1932 classic directed by Howard Hawks and written by Ben Hecht about the rise and fall of a Chicago gangster, played by Paul Muni. Mr. Pacino promptly purchased a ticket.\n\n''I had been wanting to see it since '74, when I had done a workshop production of 'Arturo Ui,' '' said Mr. Pacino, referring to Bertolt Brecht's ''Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,'' a thinly veiled fable about Hitler's rise to power set in the world of Chicago gangsters. Mr. Pacino said Brecht had been fascinated with American gangster films, especially ''Scarface.''\n\n''The film just stopped me in my tracks,'' Mr. Pacino recalled in an interview. ''All I wanted to do was imitate Paul Muni. His acting went beyond the boundaries of naturalism into another kind of expression. It was almost abstract what he did. It was almost uplifting.''\n\nAt the same time the producer Martin Bregman, a friend who had produced Pacino films like ''Dog Day Afternoon'' and ''Serpico,'' saw ''Scarface'' on television and decided to make a large-scale and contemporary version.\n\nOut of this collaboration -- with Oliver Stone writing the screenplay and Brian De Palma as director -- the film was released in 1983 to mostly terrible reviews, lackluster business and studio indifference. By any measure the film, a sprawling 170 minutes with almost operatic violence and over-the-top acting, should have disappeared.\n\n''Scarface'' developed a cult following among younger audiences, notably hip-hop stars and college students, and it is already an underground classic. A remastered print was released over the weekend in 10 cities, including New York and Los Angeles. More significant, on Sept. 30 Universal Studios Home Video will release the film on DVD with a documentary (''Def Jam Presents: Origins of a Hip-Hop Classic'') that includes interviews with Sean Combs, Snoop Dog, Eve and the rapper Scarface. They talk about the relevance of the film to their lives.\n\nMr. Combs says in the documentary that he has seen the film 63 times. ''You watch it for the lessons,'' he says.\n\nSnoop Dog says, ''It's one of the most important movies of all time.'' The rapper Scarface, who took his name from the film, says of the Pacino character, ''This cat is just like me.''\n\nIn the film -- one reviewer called it ''a wretched, fascinating car wreck of a movie'' -- Mr. Pacino plays Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee and small-time punk whose ferocious climb to the top of Miami's cocaine-laden underworld ends in his own deadly addiction and paranoia. Supporting roles include Michelle Pfeiffer as his silky mistress, Steven Bauer as his best friend and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as the sister for whom he has an incestuous fixation.\n\nVincent Canby, then film critic for The New York Times, was one of the few reviewers who enjoyed the film. He wrote that the updated ''Scarface'' was ''the most stylish and provocative -- and maybe the most vicious -- serious film about the American underworld since Francis Ford Coppola's 'Godfather.' ''\n\nAt times the film's violence and spectacle -- as well as acting -- seem so overstated that they verge on parody. ''I'm sort of out there,'' Mr. Pacino acknowledged with a laugh. But he also said that despite most of the bad reviews and tepid business in the film's first weeks, he knew the movie was special.\n\n''You make a lot of pictures, and you realize some don't have it,'' he said. ''I knew there was a pulse to this picture; I knew it was beating. And then I kept getting residuals from the movie, kept getting checks. And wherever I was filming, in Europe, people would come up to me and say, 'Hey, Tony Montana.' In Israel the Israelis came up to me and wanted to talk about 'Scarface.' The Palestinians wanted to talk about 'Scarface.' ''\n\n''It is an operatic movie,'' Mr. Pacino said. ''That was the idea of Brian De Palma. He wanted to go that way.''\n\nMr. De Palma took over the direction of the film after Sidney Lumet dropped out over script disagreements. (It was Mr. Lumet's idea to make the Pacino character a Cuban refugee.)\n\nThe film cost about $25 million to make; today it would cost about three times that.\n\nMr. De Palma said he believed that the movie stirred younger audiences, especially those in the hip-hop world, because many of them had grown up in poor neighborhoods and had become rich almost overnight. ''The hip-hop community was seeing all around them what was happening in the film -- that cocaine makes you feel all powerful, and you surround yourself with entourages and palaces and outrageous clothes and women, and you lose all touch with reality; you become numb,'' Mr. De Palma said in an interview. ''Ultimately you divorce yourself from the people you knew in the past. You ultimately explode, you perish because of your own excess.''\n\nLines of dialogue from the film -- many of them unprintable -- are now famous in the hip-hop world and are constantly repeated on the Internet. These include Tony Montana's credo: ''In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the woman.''\n\nMr. Bregman, the producer, said in an interview that the movie was initially given an X rating -- meaning no one under 17 could be admitted -- because of its language. That would have made it difficult to release on a large scale. But he appealed to the ratings board, bringing along some law enforcement officers specializing in narcotics, who said that the movie carried an antidrug message. It was given an R rating, meaning anyone under 17 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.\n\n''It's not just the hip-hop community -- white college students have 'Scarface' parties,'' Mr. Bregman said. ''The film just keeps going. It's bizarre and amazing.''\n\nPhotos: The rapper Scarface, fan of the film.

Mr. Pacino promptly purchased a ticket.    ''I had been wanting to see it since '74, when I had done a workshop production of 'Arturo Ui,' '' said Mr. Pacino, referring to Bertolt Brecht's ''Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,'' a thinly veiled fable about Hitler's rise to power set in the world of Chicago gangsters. Mr. Pacino said Brecht had been fascinated with American gangster films, especially ''Scarface.''"

        "instruction": "STRASBOURG, France, July 2— Representative Millicent Fenwick, Republican of New Jersey, turned yet another conference on European-American relations held here this week into an important sounding board.\n\nThe talk had droned through the usual themes about missiles and interest rates and the Soviet menace and went on to what some now consider the tiresome issue of human rights.\n\nMrs. Fenwick spoke up, loud and clear. She is a remarkable woman, slimly elegant, her blue-gray hair perfectly groomed, a picture of what I imagine in the poshest New Jersey country clubs, until she puffs thoughtfully at her pipe for a moment and then raises her voice.\n\n''Why are we building these awful weapons? What for?'' she said. ''The last Soviet doctor who denounced the use of psychiatric wards to punish political prisoners is now in jail. We don't want to live like that. People don't die for a second washing machine. But they die every day for ideas. Human rights, the right to dissent, the right to speak and publish -that's what we want to defend and we must say so.''\n\nThe point seemed astonishingly fresh. It suddenly drove home the fact that for some time now, we have been talking a lot about opposing Soviet expansionism, opposing Government regulation, opposing waste, opposing this and that. But we haven't heard much about what we are for, what besides fear holds the free community together.\n\nMrs. Fenwick argued the need to articulate the goals of Western society, to offer the young something to defend besides their paychecks. It struck a chord.\n\nAurelio Peccei, the mild-mannered scholar who was a co-founder of the Club of Rome, pointed out that our modern countries have developed an amazing technology in many fields. But our culture, our attitudes, most of our arguments are from another age of struggle and no longer apply to modern problems.\n\n''Where do we want to go?'' he said. ''We talk in the terms of the past and we have lost the sense of the future.'' There is a terrible silence at the top these days when it comes to telling people why they are being asked to make sacrifices and what free society is about. That lack of expressive clarity on our purposes may be an important factor in the rise of fundamentalist religions everywhere.\n\nCertainly, it is a major factor in the indifference or withdrawal of youth from conventional public debate. And it is a tangible factor in the widening chasm between American and West European opinion on the meaning and proper direction of the alliance.\n\nThere has been a good deal of noise about neutralism in Europe. Over 100,000 people gathered in Hamburg last month for churchsponsored discussions on peace and rejection of new American missiles.\n\nIn West Berlin, a free but isolated enclave surrounded by a Communist state, some 8 percent voted for the ''alternative'' list in recent elections. That is, they rejected all the parties and conventional politicians but they didn't abstain. They went to the polls and sent a message that said in effect, ''No to all of you, you give us no reason to support you.''\n\nRepresentative Fenwick quoted a stanza by William Butler Yeats to add resonance to her plea for a renewed statement of basic principles to which we can acknowledge dedication. ''Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. ''Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. ''The blood-dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere ''The ceremony of innocence is drowned. ''The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity.'' This is not self-flagellation, the debilitating criticism that the tide that sent Ronald Reagan to the White House sought to halt. It is a call for assertion, not of toughness or belligerence, but of stirring ideas.\n\nStrangely, President Reagan's great skill in communicating has not yet been turned to this necessary expression of goals. That is the element of leadership that the allies seek from the United States, not just more rockets and muscle. It is the element that the United States provided in the past and that rallied hopes and energies around the world.\n\nSomehow abuse, sentimentality and hot air have managed to turn the great phrases expressing freedom into apparent platitudes and give human rights a shopworn, impractical name. Righteousness has provoked revulsion.\n\nBut it is not moralizing to declare cherished values and the resolve to strive for them. It is not unrealistic politics or diplomacy to name the positive purpose of our efforts. On the contrary, open advocacy of humanism everywhere and open indignation at its denial anywhere is probably the only way those efforts can be sustained.\n\nRepresentative Fenwick touched a central problem of our times in pointing to the need for some freshly ''passionate intensity'' on the side of the conviction that liberty means respect for human rights.",

Klopfer is 80 years old today, and if Klopfer isn't exactly a household name it can safely be said that millions of Americans have in their homes books that he helped to popularize: the 600 titles brought out over the years by the Modern Library.\n\nPick up an old copy of one such handy edition - say Christopher Isherwood's haunting novel ''Prater Violet,'' published in 1945 - turn to the copyright page, and there you will find the names of the three Modern Library publisher-partners: Bennett Cerf, Donald S. Klopfer, Robert K. Haas. Mr. Klopfer is the surviving member of that famous publishing triumvirate. There are still 100 Modern Library books around in redesigned editions.\n\nAs chairman emeritus, Mr. Klopfer is still lending his wisdom to Random House, which publishes the Modern Library (plus Random, Knopf, Pantheon and Ballantine books, all of which are now owned by Newhouse Publications). Although the affable and outspoken publisher retired as chairman of the board in 1975, he walks from the Beekman Hotel on Park Avenue, where he lives with his wife, to the Random House building on Third Avenue and 50th Street, almost every day.\n\nIn his book-lined office, colleagues seek his advice - ''I think the quality of the books is as good or better as when Bennett and I were active'' - he handles correspondence and occasionally reads manuscripts - ''when I'm asked for an opinion.''\n\nTo the hundreds of employees wh o see the er ect, gray-haired, debonair Mr. Klopfer at Random House, he repr esents tradition and continuity. ''Donald is a presiding presence, '' said William T. Loverd, Knopf publicity director and Random H ouse spokesman. ''He reminds us who we are.''\n\nMr. Klopfer, who is modest - a trait which comes naturall y to anyone who wa s the partner of the flamboyant Cerf - and who has no official corp orate biography, says: ''I never did care what my title was. All I wa nted was for Bennett to be one step above me, because he promoted t he books. He concentrated on the editorial and promotion sid e and I on business and production. People tend to forget that, despite his celebrity as a humorist and TV personality, the thing Ben nett did best was being a book publisher.''\n\nAs young men more than a half-century ago, Mr. Klopfer and Cerf were close friends on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Cerf graduated from Columbia, Mr. Klopfer went to Williams (''I never graduated, but they gave me an honorary degree''). Later, Cerf went into his uncle's Wall Street firm, Mr. Klopfer into his family's diamond-cutting business. Cerf then decided to go to work for Horace Liveright, who published the Modern Library. Opportunity Knocks\n\n''Horace needed money because of his theatrical ventures and various debts,'' Mr. Klopfer recalled. ''Bennett came to me and said that he knew that some day we would be in publishing, and here was our chance to acquire the Modern Library, the main asset of Boni & Liveright.\n\n''Together, we raised the money and paid $215,000 in 1925 for the Modern Library name and inventory. We started out in a tiny office on West 45th Street. Bennett and I did a lot of the selling ourselves. We took turns going on the road, all along the East Coast from Portland to Richmond, and got to know all the book buyers.''\n\nIn two years, they made back their entire investment just from the popular-priced Modern Library editions. In 1927 they became regular trade-book publishers and established Random House. During the Depression, they absorbed Smith & Haas, and Robert Haas joined as a third partner. Editors and writers were attracted to Random House and the firm flourished.\n\nIn addition to concentrating on the business side, Mr. Klopfer became friends with a number of the concern's authors, including William Saroyan, Irwin Shaw and William Faulkner -''He'd get drunk and say, 'Donald, I've been a bad boy again,' but he was tremendously loyal. The feeling was mutual and we helped him even when his books weren't doing well.'' Acquires Knopf\n\nRandom House gained great prestige in 1960 when Alfred A. Knopf's company was acquired as an autonomous division. ''The best thing Bennett and I ever did was to bring in Knopf and his books,'' Mr. Klopfer said.\n\nHave things changed much in publishing in the last 50 years? ''One thing that has changed is personal - there isn't anti-Semitism in the profession,'' Mr. Klopfer said. ''In the 20's and 30's, Bennett and I and other Jewish publishers were looked down upon. We weren't invited to join the Publishers Lunch Club, where the heads of the old firms met, even though we had made a mark.\n\n''What the hell, publishing is pretty much unchanged. The big houses are still trying for best-sellers but nobody can guess what the great books will be; one comes along maybe every 10 years. All of us publish books that don't sell. Anyway, I've worked with wonderful authors and colleagues. I've had the best of it.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Donald S. Klopfer",

        "instruction": "A frog's feast is invariably movable. Being extremely fussy eaters, both frogs and toads eschew insects and other small creatures that are unwilling to demonstrate their freshness by crawling, buzzing or flying.\n\nThey are connoisseurs of protein in motion, a snobbery made possible by the possession of tongues so fast that they lend deeper meaning to the word ''zap.'' They flip out two or three inches, snap onto a wayward snack and flip back in less than 15/100ths of a second, which is faster than most eyes in nature can follow movement.\n\nHow they do this has been one of the riveting, if minor, mysteries in zoology for more than a century. Published theories date from the early 1800's, but none were adequately tested - until now.\n\nUsing microcomputers, high-speed movie cameras and a technique called synchronized electromyography, two zoologists at the University of Michigan discounted one major hypothesis and developed evidence to support a second: that the tongue works like a catapult, with muscles perpendicular to each other stiffening to flick the tongue's sticky tip out toward a meal. 'Spectacular' Muscle Action\n\n''This is really one of the more spectacular muscle actions in nature,'' said Carl Gans, a professor of zoology who specializes in studying muscles that do unusual things.\n\nWriting in the June 18 issue of the journal Science, Dr. Gans and G.C. Gorniak, now an assistant professor of zoology at Florida State University at Tallahassee, discounted the hypothesis that the throats of frogs and toads work like a crossbow, in effect, cocking and then propelling the tongue toward its target.\n\nThe two scientists concentrated their study on Bufo marinus, or the common marine toad, which has throat and tongue structures similar to many common species of toads and frogs. Unlike, for example, snakes and people, frogs and toads have tongues that are attached backward, that is, to the front of the lower jaw instead of the back of the throat.\n\nTo study their tongues, the scientists first had to train the toads in their laboratory not to be distracted from eating by lights, cameras and wires, thinner than human hairs, that were connected to their tongue and throat muscles. Comfort and Food Do the Trick\n\n''The trick is to make them feel comfortable, give them a place to hide and offer them food every day,'' Dr. Gans said in a telephone interview. The food was live beetle larvae.\n\n''The whole body of a frog's tongue is loose and flaccid and the muscle fibers are mushy,'' Dr. Gans said. ''But as soon as they are stimulated, some fibers become rigid, forming a stiff muscle rod down the center of the tongue.''\n\nAt the same time, he explained, a second group of muscle fibers, arranged perpendicularly under the base of the tongue, stiffens and rises. This group catapults the tongue rod up, around and out like a spring propelling a mousetrap. ''This action propels the soft tissue at the end of the tongue outward like a wet dishrag,'' Dr. Gans said. ''It then slaps down on the food. The toad has everything out and back in before you can recognize that something has happened.'' Catapult Lever Effect Studied\n\nOther muscle fibers are stimulated to pull the tongue back in. To discover the catapult lever effect, various tongue muscle groups were connected to machines that measure tiny increases in electrical voltage that occur when a muscle cell is stimulated by a signal from the toad's brain. By synchronizing these measurements with highspeed motion pictures (200 frames a second) of the tongue at work, they were able to isolate the major muscle groups involved in each action of the tongue.\n\nThey discovered that the hard cartilage tissue of the throat, called the hyoid, was not involved in the tongue flipping action.\n\nIllustrations: Cartoon of a frog",

        "instruction": "WHAT is Alan Jay Lerner up to these days? The answer came over the phone from his home in London: a musical adaptation of ''Idiot's Delight,'' Robert E. Sherwood's antiwar play that opened on Broadway in 1936 with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in the starring roles. Mr. Lerner, who wrote the book and lyrics for such favorites as ''My Fair Lady'' and ''Camelot,'' is again writing the book and lyrics. This time the composer is Charles Strouse, whose Broadway hits include ''Annie'' and ''Applause.''\n\n''There is not much to say at this stage of the game - except that we're doing it, and love it and are optimistic,'' said Mr. Lerner, adding that he favors the idea of opening the new musical in London next winter before bringing it to Broadway.\n\nMeanwhile, back in New York, Mr. Strouse is describing the show as ''a very contemporary - even futuristic'' adaptation of ''Idiot's Delight,'' which was set in the 1930's on the eve of another World War. Sherwood's play involved a colorful group of guests stranded in a hotel in the Italian Alps when Italy declared war on France.\n\nThis will be the first collaboration of Mr. Lerner and Mr. Strouse. ''Alan has been reading me parts of the book,'' Mr. Strouse said with surprise in his voice. ''I've never worked that way with a collaborator. He really likes to read to you.''\n\nThe musical will be called something other than ''Idiot's Delight,'' but nobody knows what yet. ''The title will probably come from the fourth song we write,'' Mr. Strouse said.\n\nBob Gunton, Alma Cuervo, Laurie Kennedy and Peter Riegert will head the cast of eight in Wendy Wasserstein's new comedy, ''Isn't It Romantic,'' opening June 4 at the Phoenix Theater. Steven Robman, the Phoenix's artistic director, will stage the play, the company's last of the season.\n\nMiss Cuervo and Miss Kennedy will play women in New York nearing the crisis of their 30th birthday. The play deals with their relationships with their mothers, with men and with each other, and with the choices they make involving careers and marriage. All this may sound like a sequel to Miss Wasserstein's play ''Uncommon Women and Others,'' which portrayed a group of women at Mount Holyoke who had many of the same concerns. But she says it's not.\n\n''When you turn 30,'' notes the playwright, who recently went through this crisis herself, ''the whole notion of getting married becomes different, less abstract. Instead of being an idea, it becomes more personal.''\n\nNo one is more surprised by the success of William Finn's new musical ''March of the Falsettos,'' at Playwrights Horizons than Michael Rupert. The 29-year-old actor didn't have high hopes the day he went into rehearsal as Marvin, the show's central character, for the role was still somewhat dim in Mr. Finn's mind, and two-thirds of the music had yet to be written.\n\n''It's been quite an experience,'' a relieved and happy Mr. Rupert was saying the other morning. The show, now playing in the 74-seat upstairs theater, will move into the 140-seat downstairs theater on May 20 for an extended run. ''When we started working on this piece, we had no idea what it was about. We truly didn't know where Marvin would end up.'' Marvin is a sad and befuddled man who walks out on his wife and son to live with his homosexual lover. But in the end he has very human yearnings for the family life he has left behind.\n\n''We had five insecure, crazy actors as guinea pigs,'' Mr. Rupert noted. ''Rehearsals were so confusing. We were given mimeographed lyrics sheets, and the next day the lyrics would all change. But that is what a workshop is all about. I had never done one before. I'm used to doing shows where there is a bound-and-finished script.''\n\nMr. Rupert has been in show business since he was 12 years old. He made his Broadway debut at 15 in the Kander-and-Ebb musical ''The Happy Time,'' and won a Tony nomination for his performance. He has also appeared on Broadway in the title role in ''Pippin,'' and most recently in the short-lived ''Shakespeare's Cabaret.''\n\n''I've never had any job other than acting,'' Mr. Rupert said. ''I've done regional theater, voice-overs on commercials and a lot of TV - guest shots on 'Marcus Welby' and 'The Waltons.' You can pick up $3,000 for doing a week's work in Hollywood. It's insane. But it allows me to do 'March of the Falsettos,' which pays all of $125 a week.''\n\nAt first, Mr. Rupert wasn't sure he wanted to do ''March of the Falsettos,'' but James Lapine, the director, talked him into it. ''He sat me down and made it sound wonderful,'' Mr. Rupert said. ''We are all surprised by the attention the show has received, except Lapine. I can't say enough good things about Lapine as a director. He is also a good psychologist. Whenever the tension would mount he'd say, 'Take 10.' I never took so many '10's' in my life.''\n\nDavid Merrick has resolved the conflict he created last week when he picked May 10 for the openng night of ''I Won't Dance,'' Oliver Hailey's new play at the Helen Hayes Theater. May 10 also happens to be the opening night of ''It Had to Be You,'' Renee Taylor and Joseph Bologna's new play at the Golden Theater. The producers of ''It Had to Be You'' had announced their date several weeks ago. Mr. Merrick created a furor among other producers, who saw his decision as a violation of their traditional respect for each other's opening dates.\n\nThe other day Mr. Merrick changed his mind and rescheduled the opening of ''I Won't Dance'' for May 10 at 2 P.M. - the first matinee opening on Broadway in decades.\n\nHundreds of Harold Clurman's friends and admirers will gather on May 17 to celebrate the new Harold Clurman Theater Artists Fund at the State University of New York at Purchase. The fund, initiated by the university's Center for the Arts to honor the late critic and director, will provide opportunities ''for emerging and established theater artists to work within the creative professional atmosphere of an ongoing four-theater producing complex.'' The immediate goal of the Center for the Arts is to raise $200,000; the long-range goal is to develop a resident theater company. Tickets, ranging from $100 to $5,000, are available by calling (914) 253-5949.\n\nNeil Simon's new comedy, ''Fools,'' starring John Rubinstein, will close May 9 at the Eugene O'Neill Theater after 14 previews and 40 regular performances, thus becoming Mr. Simon's shortest-running play ever on Broadway. ... ''The Amazin' Casey Stengel or Can't Anybody Here Speak This Game?'' has been extended until May 17 at the American Place Theater. Paul Dooley stars. ...

        "instruction": "IF the thought of being in Friday afternoon or Sunday evening summer traffic heading across the Tappan Zee Bridge makes you shudder, here is some advice from the experts:\n\n*Get a good pair of sunglasses.\n\n*Avoid traveling in prime time.\n\n*Consider alternative Hudson River crossings.\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge, opened in 1955, draws about 47 million vehicles each year, with average daily traffic of 130,000. On holidays and summer weekends, expect more, much more.\n\nOn Friday afternoons in the summer, said Nancy K. Finger of Elmsford, who lives near Interstate 287, an approach to the bridge, ''Get yourself a good book if you're trying to go across the bridge.''\n\nOfficially the Gov. Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge -- almost no one calls it that -- the 3.03-mile-long span, seven lanes wide, is the only bridge that crosses the Hudson River between Westchester County, where it connects with the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287), and Rockland County.\n\nHigh volume on the Cross Westchester, the only east-west highway that traverses the county, has a strong impact on bridge traffic. The expressway splits the eastbound and westbound sides of Westchester Avenue, called the Platinum Mile because of its many large corporations. Even when employees do not cross the bridge -- for example, they might be going to or from White Plains or one of the county's other parkways that link with the expressway -- they collectively clog the roads that lead to the bridge.\n\nAdd an accident or bad weather and traffic can be at a turtle's pace on the road's six lanes (three in each direction).\n\nAn added contributor to bridge congestion this year is the new Palisades Mall in Nyack in Rockland County, attracting customers to stores not present in Westchester.\n\nLaurie A. Smith of Elmsford regularly goes to the Jersey Shore in the summer. ''It's a question of do we want to creep across the Tappan Zee or chance the G.W.,'' she said, referring to the George Washington Bridge. ''I usually will take the Tappan Zee and literally crawl across it, or try to leave before noon on Friday.''\n\nShe added: ''You plan your whole return trip around what time you think you will be going across the bridge. On Sundays we try to come back by 11 A.M., or even come back Saturday nights.''\n\nRoberta A. Klumpp of Greenburgh said that as a ''reverse commuter'' who heads toward Rockland when the mass of traffic is Westchester-bound, she has encountered few major delays on the bridge getting to her teaching job in Nanuet. ''But when I look in the other direction and see the backup, I say, 'Thank God, I'm not going that way,' '' she said.\n\nLast year, on Thursday, July 2, the start of the Fourth of July holiday, 79,000 vehicles crossed the bridge in each direction (for a total of almost 160,000). On Labor Day weekend last year, between noon and 3 P.M., 16,499 crossed the bridge northbound, compared with 14,104 during a similar time on Friday, April 17, a nonholiday weekend.\n\nEven on nonholiday summer weekends traffic can build up, particularly southbound (toward Westchester), where the toll is collected; 82,563 crossed the bridge from Rockland last July 24, a Friday; 77,316 on the following Sunday.\n\n''The traffic gets quite bad on summer weekends, particularly Friday evenings and Sunday evenings,'' said Mark Kulewicz, the director of traffic engineering and safety for the Automobile Club of New York. ''That's from the crush of people who are headed on vacations or holiday weekends.''\n\nBut, he observed, what is bad news for summer vacationers can be good news for regular commuters. ''The regular traffic congestion for commuters in the morning and evenings tends to lighten up a bit,'' he said.\n\nJim Volpe, owner of the Wedge Service Station in Tarrytown, on Route 119 near the bridge, agreed. ''The morning and evening commutes Monday through Thursday are easier in the summer,'' he said. ''There is no waiting.''\n\nMr. Volpe, who for four years until recently commuted to his station from Rockland, added: ''Unless there is an accident. Then my service station gets swamped because a lot of people coming from Rockland get off the expressway, to take a short cut near my station and stop for soda or gas.''\n\nOfficials of the State Thruway Authority, which owns and operates the bridge, say that a continuing $28 million project to rehabilitate the bridge should not have much impact on bridge users because lane restrictions will occur during off-peak hours only and closings will not be permitted during commuter or holiday travel times. Most of the work, to resurface the bridge, will take place at night and require lane closings in the evening.\n\nA number of people interviewed said that there was actually less congestion on the Tappan Zee Bridge these days than there was a few years ago because of the growing use of E-Z Pass and the reversible lane median barriers. Also helpful are additional toll stations. There are 13 toll stations, 6 of them tandem, meaning they can serve two vehicles at a time. Three tandems were added in the late 80's and the other three in the early 90's.",

        "instruction": "NEW YORK — Verizon Communications is exploring a potential acquisition or joint venture with AOL to help it expand mobile-video offerings, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThe wireless carrier hasn’t made a formal proposal to AOL, and no agreement is imminent, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Speaking at a conference Tuesday, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said the company isn’t having ‘‘significant acquisition discussions’’ and is more interested in partnerships with media companies and content providers, rather than buying them.\n\n‘‘AOL, along with lots of other media companies, are potential for us to do partnerships,’’ McAdam said.\n\nVerizon is primarily interested in AOL’s programmatic advertising technology — the automated buying and selling of ads online — which could be paired with a future online-video product, two of the people said. With a takeover it would also gain paying subscribers and Internet properties, including the Huffington Post.\n\nAOL CEO Tim Armstrong has used digital-advertising acquisitions to transform it from the Internet portal once known for its ‘‘You’ve got mail’’ alerts. Verizon is seeking expertise in three areas: online content, mobile video, and advertising, one person said, and a venture — rather than a takeover — would keep it focused in those areas.\n\n‘‘Verizon needs a digital response and AOL has shown the best strategic foresight of navigating the digital-video world,’’ said Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Needham & Co. ‘‘Verizon can buy or build that, but it’s unlikely to build it fast enough.’’\n\nThe company also has held talks with several of AOL’s peers about how to bolster those businesses, one person said.\n\nSpokesmen for Verizon and AOL declined to comment.\n\nResearcher EMarketer Inc. projected in July that mobile advertising would lead 2014’s rise in total media ad spending in the US, with advertisers spending 83 percent more on tablets and smartphones than they did in 2013 — an increase of $8.04 billion. Verizon is looking to catch up with AT&T as wireless providers enhance their offerings. AT&T last year struck a $48.5 billion deal to acquire satellite TV provider DirecTV.\n\nWith a takeover, Verizon also would gain AOL’s 2.3 million paying members, in addition to Internet brands TechCrunch and Engadget. It’s unclear if Verizon is interested in those media properties, which draw more than 200 million unique visitors a month, the fourth-most in the United States, behind Google, Yahoo, and Facebook, according to November data from researcher ComScore Inc.\n\nOnce called America Online, AOL was one of the main portals through which people first accessed the Internet. Its trajectory peaked with a now-infamous $124 billion combination with Time Warner 15 years ago, after which it began losing customers to faster services from telephone and cable-television carriers.\n\nAfter years of losses the merger was unwound with a spinoff in late 2009.\n\nSome of AOL’s members still use its dial-up Internet service, though the company is winding down that business. If Verizon acquired the New York-based company, it could continue that process and convert some of those customers to its FiOS broadband service, one of the people said.\n\nVerizon is dedicating three executives to help develop a mobile-video service and integrate acquired technology, known as OnCue, from Intel Inc. last year and EdgeCast Networks Inc. in December 2013. AT&T and The Chernin Group announced a joint venture to acquire and develop online-video services in April 2014.\n\nVerizon is still paying off debt from buying Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless last year for $130 billion, and the company is stockpiling cash to acquire wireless spectrum in an auction that began in November. Both could hamper the New York company’s ability to make an acquisition, two people said.\n\nAOL CEO Armstrong’s investments in ad technology have brought growth, with the promise of profits not far off. His largest transaction was 2013’s $418 million purchase of Adap.tv Inc., which matches advertisers and video publishers through an exchange.\n\nThe strategy is to make AOL a company advertisers use to automate their purchases of placements on websites and online videos across the Web. While ads are everywhere online, marketers have found it difficult to ensure their messages are getting in front of their ideal audiences, a dilemma AOL’s technology is meant to address.\n\nActivist shareholder Starboard Value LP proposed last year that Yahoo explore a combination with AOL.",

( )\n\nThe Sharon Tate Family’s Account of Stardom, the Manson Murders, and a Crusade for Justice\n\nby Alisa Statman and Brie Tate\n\nThey were among the most shocking murders of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1969, seven members of the Manson “family” brutally murdered seven people in a two-day killing spree, among them one of the most famous actresses of her day, Sharon Tate.\n\nThey scrawled “Rise” and “Death to the Pigs” on the walls with the victims’ blood. Tate reportedly begged for the life of her unborn child as the group of murderers heartlessly stabbed her to death. The media went wild with the story, especially when ringleader Charles Manson carved out a swastika on his forehead during the trial.\n\nYet the shocking postscript of the story has gone largely unreported.\n\nAccording to a new book written by a surviving members of the Tate family, Charles “Tex” Watson, one of the main perpetrators of the Manson family crimes, has bizarrely befriended the daughter of one of his victims, Rosemary LaBianca, whom he helped stab a total of 41 times.\n\nSuzan LaBerge, Rosemary’s daughter, has been one of Watson’s closest friends behind bars after allegedly bonding over their shared beliefs as born-again Christians. She visits, writes and has even advocated for his release.\n\nMore than 30 years after the murder, Sharon’s mother, Doris, father, P.J., and sister, Patti, have all died of natural causes — leaving Patti’s daughter, Brie, and partner, Alisa Statman, to put together the pieces of the complicated story.\n\nOn August 1969, four members of the cult were directed by Charles Manson to kill everyone at the home of “Valley of the Dolls” actress Tate and director Roman Polanski (who was away filming during the murder).\n\nThree guests and the 8-months-pregnant actress were brutally murdered.\n\nThe next night, the Manson family entered the home of supermarket mogul Leno LaBianca (LaBerge’s stepfather) and his wife, Rosemary. Watson stabbed Leno through the throat and carved “War” in his stomach.\n\nAfter LaBerge, then 21, arrived on the scene with her brother, she reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown.\n\nWatson’s death sentence was reduced to life in prison after the death penalty was repealed in California. He was allowed conjugal visits, married and fathered four children (until conjugal visits were banned in 1996 for those serving life).\n\nBut none of this stopped LaBerge from writing to Watson, after she discovered that he had, like she had, “found God.” She reached out to Watson through his mail-order ministry, called Abounding Love Ministries.\n\nShe wrote to Watson for a year anonymously, until 1987, when she visited the killer — and told him that she was Rosemary LaBianca’s daughter. They continued speaking for three more hours, and she followed up with several more visits and regular correspondence.\n\nPatti Tate had no inkling of this when, in 1990, she met LaBerge at her daughter’s middle school, where LaBerge had coincidentally (or not) sent her own daughter.\n\nThey began to chat and Patti revealed the name of her sister, Sharon.\n\nSuzan’s eyes grew wide; “You’re never going to guess who I am. Rosemary LaBianca is my mother!” LaBerge said.\n\nPatti was taken by the coincidence and felt comfortable with another victim. So she let her daughter stay the day at LaBerge’s house, which was just two miles from her own.\n\nMeanwhile, Suzan shared the news with Watson’s wife, who relayed the message to him in prison. He thought this was the key to getting his parole date set.\n\n“Suzan LaBerge, née LaBianca, is my ace in the hole,” Watson boasted to another inmate. “The Tate kid is playing in Suzan’s yard as we speak.”\n\nPatti learned about the connection only a few hours later — and ran to LaBerge’s house to collect her daughter.\n\n“It was just horrifying. Possibly the most horrifying experience of her life,” Statman told The Post.\n\nLater that year, LaBerge did testify on Watson’s behalf, but the Tate family was also there to speak out against parole.\n\nLaBerge went on about Watson’s “loving side” as Doris, Sharon’s mother, looked on in disgust. LaBerge proved not to be an ace — his parole was denied (and continued to be a total of 14 times).\n\n“Watson watched like a proud parent at LaBerge as she read her pages,” Doris wrote in her journal at the time. “I couldn’t put my finger on it, but there was more going on than mere forgiveness.”\n\nAnd according to Statman, “no one believes” the story of the prison meeting, especially when they likely knew each other long before. That maybe the “random” targeting of the LaBianca house wasn’t so random.\n\nSuzan and Tex lived an estimated 200 feet apart in nearby apartments in Los Angeles for six months prior to Watson’s move into Manson’s home base, Spahn Ranch. Suzan’s then-boyfriend was a member of the motorcycle gang Straight Satans that often frequented Spahn Ranch.\n\n“There’s lot of speculation that they knew each other. And take that where you will — you can only imagine what that might mean,” Statman said.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 13— The Carter Administration is expected to announce tomorrow the resumption of $5 million in military aid to El Salvador that was suspended early last month after reports that Salvadoran security forces were involved in the slaying of four American women.\n\nAdministration officials said today that one factor in the decision to resume the aid, which was to include two transport helicopters, was the evidence last weekend at the start of an offensive by leftwing guerrillas that they had large quantities of Soviet-made weapons, among them rocket-launched grenades, bazookas and recoilless rifles.\n\nOther factors were said to be progress made in an investigation into the killing of three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay missionary as well as a recent restructuring of the ruling military-civilian Salvadoran junta that indicated to officials here a commitment to tighter control of the Government security forces.\n\nThe suspended aid, from the appropriation for fiscal 1981, which began Oct. 1, consists of $2.3 million in nonlethal equipment and $2.7 million for the upkeep of the helicopter transports. One official said these would be offered under a lease agreement that would not require a payback.\n\nThe Salvadoran Government's only remaining transport helicopter was reportedly destroyed in the fighting last weekend. Offensive Lacks Support\n\nAlthough sporadic fighting was reported continuing, the offensive that the guerrilla movement had said would be its final one to topple the Government has not gained popular support or resulted in the seizing of territory it hoped to use as a base for a takeover government.\n\nNevertheless, Washington concluded from the reports of the infusion of Soviet arms from both the Soviet Union and Cuba and from captured documents of battle plans that the guerrillas were better equipped and trained than had been previously thought.\n\nAdministration officials have been in contention over the issue of military aid, with those opposed asserting that it would only encourage extreme rightist members of the security forces to commit abuses and that President Carter should uphold to the end his human rights policy.\n\nBackers contend that the international arms connection cannot be ignored, that the junta has taken steps to consolidate moderate and civilian control and that developments in El Salvador are critical to the future of the entire Central American region. ---- Wounded Journalist Dies Special to the New York Times\n\nSAN SALVADOR, Jan. 13 - A South African journalist who was wounded yesterday when a land mine exploded under the car he was driving north of San Salvador died today in a hospital here after surgery.\n\nThe journalist, Ian Mates, a cameraman for the London-based television organization U.P.I.T.N., was 26 years old. At the time of the incident, he was headed for the town of Suchitoto, which was reported under guerrilla attack.\n\nTwo United States journalists riding with him - Susan Meiselas, a Magnum photographer from New York on assignment for Time, and John Hoagland of San Diego, on assignment for Newsweek -received lesser wounds and were flown today to Miami.\n\nContinued fighting was reported today in several parts of the country, but a call for a general strike as part of efforts to topple the civilian-military junta seemed to go largely unheeded here through most of the day. Most Shops Open in Capital\n\nIn downtown Salvador, most shops were open, and many buses were operating. However, the Salvadoran Association of Bus Companies said it had joined the strike in response to the call issued by the Democratic Revolutionary Front, a coalition of moderate to far-left church, political, student and guerrilla groups. (Later 20,000 Government workers walked off their jobs, United Press International reported.)\n\nUnion leaders said last week that they expected support for the general strike to develop gradually. Salvadoran Government officials and United States diplomats have said that the leftists do not have sufficiant popular backing to maintain a general strike.\n\nThis morning President Jose Napoleon Duarte made special appeals by radio for people to go to work. Except for repeating the appeals, all radio stations played music for the second day. ---- Rebels Said to Seize City\n\nSAN SALVADOR, Jan. 13 (AP) - Left-wing guerrillas seized the provincial capital of San Francisco Gotera today,but army reinforcements were sent to the city and entered it after heavy fighting, the Government reported.\n\nThe Government acknowledged sharp fighting in San Francisco Gotera, 65 miles east of San Salvador, but gave no casualty figures. In Zacatecoluca, 30 miles southeast of the capital, residents reported intense fighting from early this morning into the afternoon with ''many dead.'' They said the army controlled the town but it appeared guerrillas had blocked roads in the area.\n\nMore than 500 people have been reported killed in four days of fighting since leftist forces launched their ''all-out offensive'' to overthrow the ruling civilian-military junta.",

        "instruction": "The long and illustrious history of moving pictures all started with the zoetrope. Then there was the thaumatrope, the flip book, and my personal favorite, the phenakistoscope. And now we have (drumroll please): The Internet.\n\nPeople have been excited about moving pictures for ages. But achieving a passable animation has never been as easy or required as little talent as it does today.\n\nPreviously, we made some suggestions for sites where you can get your webcomic on. This week, we're bringing you five excellent ways to tackle animation, the next step in your pseudo-artistic journey.\n\nFor animators who would rather put in a little time rather than settle for a mediocre movie, GoAnimate is the way to go. The site offers enough customization to fully express creative genius, but it's easy enough to master without any actual animation or technical skills.\n\nFor almost every component, the website offers a choice between complete customization and a library of already configured objects. Users can either choose a character or make a completely customized one; they can choose a soundtrack or upload one; they can have the computer speak the dialogue or record it themselves. All of these components are laid out visually on an easy-to-navigate timeline.\n\nThere's also an interesting community feature similar to many social media sites. Users can collect followers, earn badges and send messages to one another. Personal dashboards track how many people view your animation, which is way more fun than feeling like you're sending your brilliant clip into cyber thin air.\n\nDevolver streamlines the animation process into a quick, six-step multiple choice project. Choose your background, characters and one of four plots; type in some dialog; choose some music; and — voila! — you have an animated movie. Despite the extremely limited customization options, it's actually not a bad looking cartoon.\n\nIt's quick to e-mail your animation to a friend, but they will need to visit the Devolver site in order to watch the movie and there's no option to download. This aspect, paired with the fact that the dialog is really the only thing you can customize, makes this site more like a more exciting way to send an e-mail message than an actual animation; much like a customized e-card. Still, there are a bunch of situations that could warrant this of animation — an inside joke, a prom date request... a marriage proposal.\n\nInstead of assigning actions to characters via a drop-down menu, Animasher users just hit a record button. Any movement that they create by dragging and dropping the images will be played back. Animators can compile multiple scenes of these moving images to complete a story.\n\nIt's a pretty painless way to make a movie, but there are some drawbacks. The images move but aren't actually animated, so it's difficult to accomplish changing expressions. As a result, the animation comes out looking more like a puppet show than a movie.\n\nSome tools that make the site more interesting are the ability to add your own images, record dialog with a microphone and add video clips. If you like the scrapbook-like look and process, there aren't any better, free options out there without downloading or having actual software knowledge.\n\nAs far as visual quality goes, this site is impressive (which is probably the cause of the slow preview load times). The workspace is a little different than the other animation sites mentioned in this article. All character movement, sound bytes, expressions and gestures are added directly into the script where you type the dialog.\n\nUnfortunately, the site's options for free use are limited. Sarah Palin is one of two default characters in the \"Starz\" theme, for instance, but any other choices require cash commitment before you're able to publish your animation. The same is true for \"premium objects,\" like different backgrounds that you're able to preview but not publish, unless you pay. As evidenced by the site's YouTube channel, there are definitely opportunities to makes some pretty cool movies, but the free version seems limited.\n\nYou can't create much of a story with Voki, but you can create an animated speaking avatar. The site is extremely easy to use. Just choose a character base (choices range from Uncle Sam to classic normal-looking people), adjust the background and colors, and add a voice. To put words in your avatar's mouth, you can either call a number and leave a message, type out a greeting and let the computer generate a voice with the accent of your choice, or record a message with your computer's microphone. When you're finished, you can embed the code in your website or e-mail your message to a friend.\n\nRemember those choose your-own-adventure novels? This animation site applies the same concept to short cartoons. The site partners with Teletoon, a Canadian animation channel, to give children a starter in animation.\n\nThe site challenges you to use its animation tool to finish the stories, which chronicle the adventures of siblings Eva and Edgar. The best finished stories are then recorded by voice actors and turned into TV spots.\n\nWhich site was your favorite? What animation sites do you use? What features would you love to see in sites like these?

But now, that spare design approach looks new again: Buildings with clean, geometric interiors are beginning to replace the more ornamental rooms that post-modernists endorse.\n\nIn a move toward achieving this spare style, architects are looking with fresh eyes at the German-born Mies, whose lean steel and glass skyscrapers and spare interiors symbolized the modernist esthetic.\n\n''While some architects have never stopped looking at Mies, others are beginning to see modernism in a new way,'' said Arthur Drexler, director of the department of architecture and design for the Museum of Modern Art, where a major retrospective of Mies's designs will be on view beginning Feb. 10 to commemorate the centennial of his birth.\n\n''Post-modernism has been around for 20 years,'' he continued. ''It's now as vulnerable to criticism as modernism has been.''\n\nAnd indeed, there is a generation of younger architects who were taught that ''less is a bore'' by such post-modernists as Robert Venturi, Charles Moore and Michael Graves (who were themselves brought up on Mies's famous adage ''Less is more''), and many of these younger architects are now reacting against their masters. ''There are always design cycles: Each generation rebels against their teachers,'' said Franklin D. Israel, a Los Angeles architect who studied with Venturi at the University of Pennsylvania 18 years ago.\n\n''Architects today are once again interested in simpler designs,'' he said.\n\nMr. Israel points out that some of the most famous post-modern buildings may appear, with their ornamented facades, to represent a totally different design philosophy, but in reality a common thread exits. ''Take the A.T.&T. building,'' he said. ''The whole post-modernist esthetic of using granite as a veneer is not so different from the way the modernists clad steel structures with a skin of glass.''\n\nBesides glass, what seems to appeal these days is Mies's careful attention to detail and the ways he used bronze, stone, chrome and steel. Also being imitated are the geometric Miesian interiors: large open areas interrupted only by free-standing walls and ''floating'' cabinets raised above the floors and ending below the ceilings.\n\nAccording to Don Powell, a partner in the Chicago firm of Powell/ Kleinschmidt Architects, there is new interest in the ways the modernists handled structural materials. ''Since Mies was the major technocrat of the 20th century, it makes sense that architects have begun to examine his work again,'' Mr. Powell explained.\n\n''He was an artist when it came to crafting materials.''\n\nMies's fame began in Germany in the early 1920's with such radical designs as steel and glass skyscrapers and his use of horizontal ribbon windows. In 1930 he became director of the Bauhaus School of Architecture and Design in Dessau, Germany.\n\nSeven years later the architect immigrated to the United States to head the School of Architecture at the Armour, now Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, where he designed many major buildings, including the celebrated 1950 Farnsworth house.\n\nLiving in Chicago, Mr. Powell feels a close affinity to Mies's work. He also lives in one of the Mies apartment buildings on Lake Shore Drive, a steel and glass structure originally intended as a skyscraper of open-plan apartments. In 1952, however, when it was being finished, the builder was afraid this modernist notion was too avant-garde for prospective tenants.\n\nSo instead, the apartments were laid out in conventional rooms. Working with his partner, Robert Kleinschmidt, Mr. Powell renovated his two-bedroom apartment. ''I followed the open plan that I thought Mies had originally intended,'' Mr. Powell said. The only conventional wall left standing is one closing off the bedroom. The main portion of the apartment, based on a modular grid, incorporates many Miesian trademarks: A teak storage unit 60 inches high divides the apartment into a T shape. ''The space divider, which also doubles as a storage unit, is used in place of a traditional interior wall,''\n\nMr. Powell said. The Miesian notion of free-flowing space was achieved by Mr Powell not only with cabinetry but also by the arrangement of the furniture. True to modernist principles, pieces are never placed against a wall but are used as centerpieces in each area. By raising all the dividers several inches above the travertine floor and having them not reach the ceiling, another Mies idea, the notion of floating space is carried from floor to ceiling.\n\nAll the furniture in Mr. Powell's apartment, if not original Mies pieces, was designed in the same spirit. The sofa was made in Germany in 1938, and the leather stools in the living area were designed by Mies for the 1929 Barcelona Pavilion.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 12— Following are excerpts from statements issued today by Senators sitting in judgment in the impeachment trial of President Clinton:\n\nAs this case has been argued in this chamber, I have become convinced that the perjury charges of Article I are not fully substantiated by the record. The President's grand jury testimony is replete with lies, half-truths, and evasions. But significantly, not all evasion is lying, and not all lying is perjury. Even blatantly misleading testimony that all fair-minded people would consider dishonest may not actually constitute perjury, as the law defines it. . . .\n\nThe evidence supporting Article II is more convincing. Indeed, the case presented by the House managers proves to my satisfaction that the President did, in fact, obstruct justice in Paula Jones's civil rights case.\n\nWhile the circumstances surrounding Monica Lewinsky's filing of a false affidavit are unclear, there is no doubt in my mind that the frantic efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job, the retrieval and concealment of gifts under the bed of the President's secretary, and, most egregious, the President's blatant coaching of Betty Currie -- not once, but twice -- were clear attempts to tamper with witnesses and obstruct justice.\n\nIndeed, if I were a juror in an ordinary criminal case, I might very well vote to convict faced with these facts.\n\nNevertheless, I do not think that the President's actions constitute a high crime or misdemeanor. . . .\n\nI will cast my vote not for the current President, but for the Presidency. I believe that in order to convict, we must conclude from the evidence presented to us with no room for doubt that our Constitution will be injured and our democracy suffer should the President remain in office one moment more.\n\nIn this instance, the claims against the President fail to reach this very high standard.\n\nThe Senate's responsibility in this impeachment trial was not to determine whether the President had done something wrong or something that was morally unacceptable.\n\nNor was it our responsibility to determine whether the President should be punished; that is left for censure and possibly for criminal prosecution in the courts.\n\nThe Constitution required us to determine whether the President's conduct rose to the level of an impeachable offense that warranted removing him from office.\n\nI do not believe that his conduct rose to that level on either perjury or obstruction of justice. Therefore, I voted against conviction.\n\nIt is precisely in good times, with the President high in the polls, that it is incumbent upon the Senate to exercise very thoroughly and carefully the responsibility under the Constitution to make the difficult decision on whether the President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors warranting his removal from office.\n\nIf we are to have a Government of laws and not of men and not of public opinion polls, then we must judge the President on the evidence presented to us. I believe that the acts that he committed constitute high crimes and misdemeanors warranting his conviction.\n\nI should note that the Senate made a serious mistake in beginning the proceedings by limiting the ability of the House managers to call witnesses. The absence of witnesses to testify to the acts alleged as the basis of impeachment charges significantly impeded the progress toward resolving the allegations against the President. I trust that the Senate will not make the same mistake in future impeachment proceedings.\n\nClearly the President's behavior was wrong. Clearly it was immoral. Clearly his actions fall far below the conduct Americans should expect of their Chief Executive. He cannot escape history and will be treated harshly by it. Ultimately, he will be judged for his sins by that tribunal before which we all must stand one day. But we must apply a mortal, constitutional standard here.\n\nIt is not enough that I deplore the President's conduct. It is not enough that I question his morals, his character or his veracity. The Constitution does not permit his removal for these reasons because, without proof of more, they do not constitute ''high crimes.'' . . .\n\nIn the end, on both Articles, we are left with dueling accounts, disputed inferences and contested suggestions. It is not enough to imply or infer or assume that a President must be removed. The case must be overwhelming. Here, it is not.\n\nThe President came through a difficult childhood as I did, and I genuinely like him and feel sorry for both him and his family. But after agonizing as many of my Senate friends have, I remember the first question my then 9-year-old son, Cohn, asked me 17 years ago when I told him I was going to run for public office. He asked, ''Dad, are you going to lie and stuff?'' I told him, ''No.'' Human frailties notwithstanding, elected officials should not ''lie and stuff.'' . . .\n\nIf we are not going to honor our oath, why don't we get rid of it and have an every-man-for-himself kind of elected official?\n\nBetter yet, let's change it. Mr. Chief Justice, you could say: ''Senators-elect. Raise your right hand and repeat after me: 'On my honor, I'll do my best, to help myself and lie like the rest.' ''\n\nI took a solemn oath -- perhaps it is the only thing in common I share with John F. Kennedy, Harry Truman and Daniel Webster as well as the founders of this nation -- and that is why honoring it is all the more important to me.\n\nSimply speaking, the President did, too. And, so even though I like him personally, I find I can only vote one way. And that is guilty on both articles.\n\nPresident Clinton has committed serious offenses. His personal conduct in this matter was, as I have said before, wrongful, reprehensible and indefensible. He has admitted to personal offenses, and will be appropriately judged for his misconduct elsewhere. In my judgment, under all the oaths I have taken under the United States Constitution, his offenses do not rise to the required level for impeachable offenses under the United States Constitution.\n\nWhile the legal nuances offered by both sides were interesting and essential, I kept thinking as I sat listening, that the most obvious and important, but unstated, question was: What standard of conduct should we insist our President live up to?\n\nOnly by taking into account this question do I believe that we in the Senate can properly interpret our founding fathers' impeachment criteria comprised of bribery, treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Clearly, the Constitution recognizes that a President may be impeached not only for bribery and treason, but also for other actions that destroy the underlying integrity of the Presidency or the equal justice for all guarantee of the Judiciary. . . .\n\nIn this day and age of public yearning for heroes, we criticize basketball, football and baseball players and actors and singers who commit crimes or otherwise fail to be good role models. One of those celebrities said a few years ago that he was only a basketball player, not a role model. He said in essence: Want a role model? Look to the President.\n\nDo not underestimate, my friends, the corrupting and cynical signal we will send if we fail to enforce the highest standards of conduct on the most powerful man in the nation.\n\nJames Wilson, an 18th-century constitutional scholar, has written that impeachment was designed for ''great and publick offences by which the Commonwealth was brought into danger.''\n\nThese charges against the President just do not measure up to that standard. Hiding presents under a bed. Asking a secretary leading questions. These can hardly be the great and public offenses that our founding fathers had in mind. These charges, and the facts behind them, simply do not bring our commonwealth into danger. . . .\n\nOur freedom and liberty are not threatened by the wrongful acts of this President. But our freedom and liberty might be threatened if a minority can overturn the will of the majority.\n\nIn an impeachment process steeped in partisanship, I have tried to screen out my own strong partisan sentiments by asking a simple question: Would I vote to convict President Ronald Reagan or President George Bush if they had committed the acts that President Clinton has committed? The answer is a sad but firm yes. . . .\n\nI have asked myself how men from an era when honor was valued above all other traits, men like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and James Madison, might have viewed a President who committed perjury and obstruction of justice for personal and political gain.\n\nWould they believe that denying another citizen equal protection of the law was a betrayal of a public trust? It seems to me the men who pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor in order to establish our nation of laws would find President Clinton's behavior to be a high crime and misdemeanor.\n\nThe perjury charge, I believe, is just not there. The evidence is not there to support it. I know many of you believe it is there. I respect your view on that, I don't believe it is there. The obstruction charge is a totally different matter. And this is the way I have thought about the obstruction charge.\n\nI view, in my mind's eye, the scales of justice. And on one side, where the prosecution makes an allegation, I put their evidence. On the other side, I put the defense evidence. And I do believe that for a charge this serious that the proper standard is beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSo after that evidence is put on both sides of the scale of justice, what happens? . . . At best the scale stays even. In my judgment, it actually tilts for the defense. There is no way it rises to the level of ''beyond a reasonable doubt.''\n\nEvery trial I have ever been in has had one moment, one quintessential moment when the entirety of the trial was described. And in this case we have such a moment. There was a question that had my name on it. The reality is, Senator Kohl wrote it -- I tagged on -- but it was a great question.\n\nThe question was: Is this a matter about which reasonable people can differ? I will never forget Manager Lindsey Graham coming to this microphone and his answer was, ''Absolutely.'' Now if the prosecution concedes that reasonable people can differ about this, how can we not have reasonable doubt?\n\nThe President's actions are having a profound impact on our society. His misdeeds have caused many to mistrust elected officials. Cynicism is swelling among the grass roots. His breach of trust has eroded the public's faith in the office of the Presidency. The President's wrongdoing has painted all of us in Washington with a rather broad brush. . . .\n\nThe true tragedy in this case is the collapse of the President's moral authority. He undermined himself when he wagged his finger and lied to the nation on national TV, denying a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. That did more damage to his credibility than any other single act.\n\nThere was no better reason than that for the resignation by this President. I did not personally call for his resignation. That's something the President should decide on his own. But once you lose your moral authority to lead, you're a failure as a leader. . . . The Senate has closed this chapter in American history. It may not be the final chapter in this story.\n\nNonetheless, our decision in this impeachment trial will stand against the test of time. You only truly understand the present when it is past. In that respect, future generations will serve as jury. And in the end, history will serve as the final judge.\n\nWhen our founding fathers gathered in Philadelphia to form our national government, they clearly understood the profound responsibilities they were entrusting to all citizens. An anxious crowd gathered outside of Independence Hall as the delegates to the Constitutional Convention completed their work. One in the crowd shouted out, ''What have you given us?'' Without hesitation, Benjamin Franklin snapped, ''A republic -- if you can keep it.''\n\nMr. Franklin, may I say with deep humility, I have done my best. I have done what my conscience directs. I have done my duty to ''keep'' the republic. . . .\n\nIt is for the future to judge, but this will stand as one of the most tragic chapters in the history of the executive branch. I have grave concerns about the accelerating effect that this terrible experience will have upon the growing cynical view of politics, politicians and the making of public law and policy. What message does this chapter send to our able young people whom we are trying to encourage to enter public service? . . .\n\nTo accord the President -- the Office of the Presidency and the executive branch -- the greatest degree of protection and fairness, I will strictly adhere to the highest level of proof. To find the President guilty on a count, I must be convinced that the weight of the evidence, ''beyond a reasonable doubt,'' is the foundation for my votes. . . .\n\nNo matter how great my deep disappointment in President Clinton, as a person, he is entitled to the highest standard of due process, as is every other citizen.\n\nAccordingly, I find that the weight of the evidence does not provide a basis to find the President guilty on Article I. . . .\n\nThe perjury charge is inextricably dependent on the depositions, affidavits and assertions of Ms. Lewinsky. In my view, she lacks legal credibility, as evidenced by her many conflicting actions and statements over a long period of time. Likewise, President Clinton, regrettably, lacks credibility. A colleague reminded me of a quote by Mark Twain who said: ''The next best thing to a lie is a true story no one will believe.''\n\nOn Article II, obstruction of justice, I find that President Clinton is guilty as charged. I will vote to convict. . . .\n\nJust two years ago, on a freezing January day, I stood near the Chief Justice, on the west front of the Capitol, as the President took the oath of office. With hand upon the Bible, he swore to ''faithfully'' execute his office, twice conferred to him by the power of the American people, and to ''preserve, protect, and defend'' our Constitution. He has failed.\n\nWith all due respect to historians and constitutional scholars who may know more or feel differently, it is my sense that the case against William Jefferson Clinton is the first close case or ''hard'' case of Presidential impeachment in our nation's long history. This case lies in the middle, between the rather weak case brought to impeach President Andrew Johnson, and the overwhelming series of allegations that would have led to President Nixon's impeachment if he had not resigned. This one is a hard case and senators may see it either way.\n\nThe singlemost salient fact in this case is that on Nov. 5, 1996, over 47 million Americans voted to re-elect William Jefferson Clinton as President of the United States. . . .\n\nThe people choose their leaders in America, and we must not lightly reverse their will. To overrule the voters, the offense must be grave and the case must be very strong.\n\nWhile overturning an election is the most severe constitutional sanction in our democracy, this President has chosen to conduct himself in such a manner as to run the risk that the U.S. Senate reasonably could conclude that he has committed ''high crimes and misdemeanors.'' That is not the conclusion I ultimately reached.\n\nThe primary issue raised here is one that has plagued the 20th century. It is the concept that everything is relative, that there is no definable right or wrong. This century has produced some truly horrific ideas: the concept of popular totalitarianism, otherwise known as fascism or communism; the concept of a socialized marketplace; and the idea that all things ethical can be relative. . . .\n\nAre the President's crimes, which have been fairly proven, all that important? Should crimes not be looked at in relation to the person committing them and his contribution or importance to society?\n\nThese questions are the essence of the President's defense.\n\nIn a country based on the system of laws, which is really the great gift given to us under the terms of our Constitution, there needs to be a consistency of application. The idea that all people are equal under the law is not a relative term.\n\nClearly, the framers intended the House and the Senate to use the impeachment power cautiously, and not wield it promiscuously for partisan political purposes. Sadly, in this case, Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the President, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the framers rejected recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or the will of the American people. . . .\n\nWhile trying to persuade senators to convict President Clinton, the House managers argued relentlessly for the opportunity to examine witnesses during the trial. The hypocrisy in the position of the House managers on witnesses was obvious. They did not think it was necessary to call witnesses in the House proceedings. They demeaned the House by their partisan excesses. But they were shameless in their attempt to force the Senate to wallow in witnesses.\n\nOur Republican friends have desperately been trying to produce a two-thirds majority to remove the President from office. But their efforts have succeeded only in turning a serious constitutional process into a partisan process that demeaned both the House and the Senate and became a painful ordeal for the entire country. . . .\n\nThis trial is not about punishment. It's not about getting our pound of flesh from the Democrats. It's not about getting our retribution on the President. It's not political vengeance. It's not about polls. If polls had prevailed, Andrew Johnson would have been removed, and that would have been wrong. To argue that a popular President should not be removed regardless of his actions, merely because he is popular, is to lower our constitutional republic to a meaningless level.\n\nTo say popularity should be a factor in our decision is to say that bad poll numbers and unpopularity is an argument for removal of a President. How contrary to our constitutional system. The popularity of this President should never even have been mentioned, in my opinion. Nor should political consequences of our votes be the basis for our decision of whether to remove this President. . . .\n\nToday is a somber day for our country. This trial has been a sad chapter of American history, and I have a heavy heart. As difficult as these votes will be, I know that I could not serve the people of Arkansas with a clear conscience unless I do what I believe is right and uphold the law. I will vote guilty on both articles of impeachment.\n\nThe country does not believe the fiber of our nation is unraveling over the President's egregious behavior, because most people have a sense of proportion about this case that seems totally lacking in the House managers' presentation.\n\nNo parent or school in America is teaching kids that lying or abusing the justice system is now okay. And I say the President's predicament does not make it harder to do so. No amount of inflated rhetoric, or ideological or moral hyperextension, can lift the personal, venial aspects of the President's actions to the kind of threat to the fabric of the country contemplated by the founding fathers. . . .\n\nNo matter the words about not hating Bill Clinton, no matter the disclaimers about partisanship, I sensed at times not just a scorn, but snarling, trembling venom that told us the President is a criminal, and that ''we need to know who our President is.'' Well, the President is certainly a sinner. We all are. And he may even have committed a crime. But just plain and simply measured against the test of history so eloquently articulated by the Senator from New York this morning, and by the Senator from Delaware yesterday, this is not in any measure on the order of high crime and misdemeanor so clearly contemplated by the founding fathers.\n\nI will vote not to convict on both articles because the factual, legal and constitutional standard for removal was not met.\n\nI'm not prepared to say, however, that perjury and obstruction of justice are not impeachable offenses, because I believe it would be a mistake to attempt to do that which the founders chose not to do -- to define what is impeachable with specificity.\n\nFor impeachment to remain what our forefathers intended it to be, a deterrent to misconduct and a means to protect the republic, future generations should be free in each case to examine the facts, apply the law and follow the Constitution, and to render impartial justice.\n\nThat is the impeachment process we have inherited from those who came before us, and that is the precedent we bequeath to the ongoing chronicles of American history. . . .\n\nIn our limited role, we are not called upon to judge him as husband and father, for that is the province of his family. We are not called upon to judge him as accused citizen, for that is the province of the courts. We are not called upon to judge him as sinner, for that is the province of God. And we are not called upon to judge his legacy, for that is the province of history.\n\nThe House managers' case on both counts was thin and circumstantial. . . .\n\nOverall, the House managers' assertions about perjury rested on President Clinton's vague and unhelpful responses to the independent counsel's questions. While those responses may have been frustrating to the independent counsel, the Republican House managers, and perhaps the American public, they were not perjurious as defined by law.\n\nSimilarly, the case presented by the Republican House managers did not present sufficient direct evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the President obstructed justice. Instead, they relied on extensive conjecture about what the President ''may'' have been thinking. In fact, there was credible testimony by multiple witnesses that was directly contrary to the House managers' conjecture, leaving ample room for doubt.\n\nI sometimes say one of the few qualifications I have for the U.S. Senate is I am not a lawyer. So that when I read the Constitution, I know what it says; when I read the oath of office, I know what it says; when I read the law, I know what it says. I don't have to clutter up my mind with what the definition of 'is' is. So it makes it a little easier for me. . . .\n\nFirst, insofar as perjury is concerned -- lying under oath -- I might be wrong, but I don't think there is a Senator in this Chamber who doesn't believe the President lied under oath. . . .\n\nSecond, as a non-attorney, I have a hard time reconciling the idea that there might be certain permissible exceptions to telling the truth under oath. . . .\n\nI know that morality is not supposed to be the issue here. We are supposed to concentrate on the two specific Articles of Impeachment. However, I don't think anyone can completely compartmentalize himself and totally disregard other things going on.\n\nI think we have seen the truth. And I think the final truth is that this President should be held to the very highest of standards.\n\nWhat is striking about this case is the President's persistent, sustained, carefully calculated, deliberate and callous manipulation of the judicial process for over a year. . . .\n\nAn acquittal in this case will make it much harder to deal properly with similar conduct in the future. We will be hard pressed to perpetuate a double standard, so the lowest common denominator of conduct will be established as the permissible norm. And this cannot help but weaken the ability of courts to enforce truth-telling and prevent obstruction of justice.\n\nThe precedent set by this case may not change the law overnight, but this unforgettable episode is now part of the institutional life of our country. The chief magistrate perverted justice and remained in power. The lesson is corrosive. Like water dripping on a rock, it eventually makes a deep hollow in the American justice system.\n\nImpeachment is a power singularly lacking any of the checks and balances on which the framers depended. It is solely a power of the Congress. Do not doubt that it could bring radical instability to the American Government. . . .\n\nSenators, do not take the imprudent risk that removing William Jefferson Clinton for low crimes will not in the end jeopardize the Constitution itself. Censure him by all means. He will be gone in less than two years. But do not let his misdeeds put in jeopardy the Constitution we are sworn to uphold and defend.\n\nI and others have been guided, first, by this question: Has the prosecution provided evidence beyond a reasonable doubt; and, second, if so, do the President's offenses rise to the level of gravity laid out by our founders in the Constitution? . . .\n\nI believe -- I believe strongly -- that the record shows that on both principles the answer is no. . . .\n\nI also share the view expressed by many of my colleagues on the process which brought us here: an investigation by an independent counsel which exceeded the bounds of propriety; a decision by the Supreme Court subjecting sitting Presidents to civil suits -- it is my prediction that every future President will be faced with legal trauma as a result -- a deeply flawed proceeding in the House Judiciary Committee, which in an unprecedented fashion effectively relinquished its obligation to independently weigh the case for impeachment; the disappointing decision to deny members of the Senate and the House the opportunity to vote on a censure resolution, even though I believe it would be supported by a majority in both houses; and finally, the bitterly partisan nature of all the actions taken by the House of Representatives in handling this case.\n\nBut as deeply disappointed as I am with the process, it pales in comparison to the disappointment I feel toward this President. Maybe it is because I had such high expectations. Maybe it is because he holds so many dreams and aspirations that I hold about our country. Maybe it is because he is my friend. I have never been, nor ever expect to be, so bitterly disappointed again. . . .\n\nWhatever legal consequences may follow from this President's actions, the case made by the House managers does not satisfy the exacting standard for removal.\n\nYou can't go through a process like this without learning some things. I think we learned some things about the facts and just how bad some of the President's actions were. But we also learned some things about the law and just how high the founding fathers set the impeachment bar. Not even crimes are always enough to remove a President. I thought that bar was reached on Article II.\n\nThe acts that the President committed included repeated lies, witness tampering, the defaming of those who might testify truthfully and facilitating the filing of a court document he had reason to know was false.\n\nThe President's repeated obstructions denied the legal rights of an American citizen to have her day in court. They were undertaken over many months with cold deliberation. The pattern of disrespect for the law exhibited by the President, as well as the harm it caused to the Federal courts, warrants his conviction.\n\nI didn't think Article I was as strong. Perjury is very hard to prove, and the President's shoddy actions here are probably not the kind of things the Founding Fathers intended to cause removal from office.\n\nWe went through the process and the system worked, whether or not we liked the result. It's time now to put it behind us and get on with the business of the nation.\n\nBecause these offenses are grounds for removal, and because they involve criminal charges, I believe that the Senate had to use the high standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in reviewing the evidence. Furthermore, I felt that the House managers had the burden of proving all the elements of these charges.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, I believe that the House managers proved beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton obstructed justice. Therefore, I voted for his conviction and removal for the offenses charged in Article II. However, I do not believe that the House managers met the legal requirements of proving perjury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, I voted against conviction and removal for the offenses charged in Article I.\n\nBe it understood, the Senate tried the President because the Constitution requires that we do so. There is no exception for popular Presidents, such as William Jefferson Clinton. The Constitution provides for this process to be applied to everyone evenhandedly. . . .\n\nThe callous disregard for the soul of another human being and the unsympathetic wounding of the character of another carried out by the President using the apparatus of the Presidency is chilling and deserves condemnation by those who cherish freedom.\n\nWe in Kansas know that you don't call witnesses in the middle of the night unless you want to sway them. The President did so.\n\nWe in Kansas know that you don't urge hiding legal evidence under the bed unless you want to affect the outcome of a legal proceeding. The President did so.\n\nWe in Kansas know that you don't hide behind the meaning of ''is'' when you are asked a direct question. The President did so.\n\nDo these actions rise to the level envisioned by our founding fathers in the Constitution as ''high crimes and misdemeanors'' so warranting removal from office? Our Constitution requires that the threshold for that judgment must be set by each senator sitting as a juror.\n\nAgain, I believe an open-minded individual applying Kansas common sense would reach the conclusion that I reached.\n\nThe President is at the helm of the executive branch of the Government, which is charged with enforcing the law. What use is it for the Congress to make the law and the courts to interpret the law, if the President does not enforce it? We must bring the power of the three branches of government back into balance. Otherwise, it is a threat to the structure of the Government. Similarly, the law should be applied to each citizen equally. Otherwise, it is a breach of the public trust. Clearly, the public good is served by removing this President.\n\nIt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that President William Jefferson Clinton perjured himself before a Federal grand jury and has persisted in a continuous pattern of lying and obstructing justice. The chief law-enforcement officer of the land, whose oath of office calls on him to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, crossed the line and failed to defend and protect the law and, in fact, attacked the law and the rights of a fellow citizen. Under our Constitution, equal justice requires that he forfeit his office. For these reasons, I felt compelled to vote to convict and remove the President from office. . . .\n\nIt is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth. I fear that an acquittal of this President will weaken the legal system by providing an option for those who consider being less than truthful in court. Whereas the handling of the case against President Nixon clearly strengthened the nation's respect for law, justice and truth, the Clinton impeachment may unfortunately have the opposite result.\n\nBecause it is clear that these crimes are high crimes and misdemeanors, the Constitution leaves no further discretion: It states that the President ''shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n\nThis is the only conclusion that I believe is consistent with my oath to do impartial justice. This case is, in large measure, about the importance of oaths. The President's failure to honor his oath necessitated this proceeding. Some might see a vote to acquit as expedient, but such a vote would be against the evidence, and I could not do further damage to our culture by disregarding my oath.\n\nI find that William Jefferson Clinton did commit perjury and obstruct justice; that these offenses rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors; that William Jefferson Clinton should be convicted under the articles of impeachment, and that he must be removed as President. . . .\n\nPresident Clinton repeatedly chose to lie and obstruct justice rather than tell the truth and comply with court orders throughout this ordeal. By his words and deeds, he chose to place himself above the law. By his words and deeds, he has undermined the rule of law in America to the great harm of this nation. By his own words and deeds, he has undermined the truth-finding function of the judiciary, at great harm to that branch of our Government.\n\nI do not take pleasure or gain any sense of gratification for the decision I must make today. For literally months, night and day, I have anguished over the serious accusations against President Clinton and what they mean for our country, our society and our children. . . .\n\nCommitting crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office. These offenses were committed by the chief executive of our country, the individual who swore to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.\n\nThis great nation can tolerate a President who makes mistakes. But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up. Any other citizen would be prosecuted for these crimes.\n\nBut President Clinton did more than just break the law. He broke his oath of office and broke faith with the American people. . . .\n\nI will vote for conviction on both articles of impeachment, not because I want to but because I must. Upholding our Constitution -- a sacred document that Americans have fought and died for -- is more important than any one person, including the President of the United States.\n\nThe purpose of this ordeal was never to punish the President, but to protect the Republic. We in the Senate never asked for this mission, but having found it on our plates, our obligation under the Constitution was to move forward and to exercise impartial justice. That principle has been uppermost in my mind, and I am confident my vote accurately reflects fulfillment of this mission.\n\nFrom the beginning of this process, I focused on undertaking my role as an impartial juror -- a trier of fact. I have examined the history books, the rule of law and the evidence at hand. I have listened carefully and intently to the arguments of the House Managers and the President's lawyers, and I have listened to my constituents and to my colleagues. What I listened to most intently, however, was my heart and my conscience. In the end, I heard the only right answer and concluded that the prosecutors had made their case. The President, indeed, is guilty as charged.\n\nThe illicit sexual affair which the President engaged in, and the President's efforts to conceal that affair, are permanent black marks on his Presidency. His actions were deplorable, indefensible and immoral.\n\nBut however reprehensible these acts were, they are not impeachable offenses. They did not endanger the Government. They were not the ''stuff'' which the writers of the Constitution had in mind when they used the phrase ''high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n\nI bear no animosity for the President. I take no partisan satisfaction from this matter. I don't lightly dismiss the public's clear opposition to conviction. And I am genuinely concerned that the institution of the Presidency not be harmed, either by the President's conduct, or by Congress' reaction to his conduct.\n\nIndeed, I take no satisfaction at all from this vote, with one exception and an important exception it is, that by voting to convict I have been spared reproach by my conscience for shirking my duty.\n\nThe Senate faces an awful choice, to be sure. But, to my mind, it is a clear choice. I am persuaded that the President has violated his oath of office by committing perjury and by obstructing justice, and that by so doing he has forfeited his office. . . .\n\nIf a clear majority of the American people were to demand the conviction of the President, should I vote for his conviction even if I believed the President to be innocent of the offenses he is charged with? Of course not. Neither, then, should I let public opinion restrain me from voting to convict if I determine the President is guilty.\n\nPhotos (pgs. A13 & A14)",

        "instruction": "A new leak has been discovered in the tubing of a steam generator at the Indian Point 3 nuclear plant - one of 17 in the country where such tubing has been affected by rust.\n\nThe leak has delayed plans by the Power Authority of the State of New York to put the plant back into service after several weeks of routine maintenance. The authority, which said it was conducting inspections of the plant's steam generator system, said yesterday that it did not know how long the plant would be out of service.\n\nIndian Point 3 and the adjacent Indian Point 2, both in the Westchester County village of Buchanan, are owned by the Consolidated Edison Company. Indian Point 2 has also been identified as a plant with a rust problem.\n\nCause of Leak Not Known\n\nA Power Authority spokesman, Stephen Shoenholz, said late today that the agency did not know the cause of the new leak and did not know whether it was caused by rust. ''It may or may not involve corrosion,'' he said.\n\nHe added, however, that the inspection undertaken so far, involving only one of the plant's four steam generators, had ruled out two specific types of rust damage, one called ''denting'' and the other known as ''wastage.''\n\n''There may or may not be a different form of corrosion, but we don't know at this point,'' he said. In denting, the tubing becomes pinched at its support plates inside the steam generator as rusts builds up in the plates. Both Indian Point 2 and 3 have experienced denting. In wastage, the tube walls are eaten away by rust. Wastage ha s been experienced in other plants.\n\nThe corrosion occurs when salt and air enter the plants. Brackish Hudson River water is the source of salt at the Indian Point site at Buchanan.\n\nThe steam generators are major cylindrical-shaped components of the plants. Each generator contains bundles of the metal tubing. The tubes - there are 3,260 tubes in each generator -carry the hot, radioactive water from the reactor's uranium core. They heat nonradioactive water in which they are immersed, turning the nonradioactive water to steam that drives the plant's turbine.\n\nThe Power Authority said it would plug the tube where the new leak was discovered. It said it would also plug at least nine other tubes with a potential for leaking ''as a preventive measure.'' Plugging the tubes - the generators are built with extra tubes so they can be plugged when leaks develop - is a standard practice, but if too many are plugged the core cannot be cooled properly and the reaction must be slowed, producing less steam and less electricity.\n\nSteam generators are designed to last the 40-year life of a nuclear plant, but four plants have already been shut around the country for expensive, protracted repairs to their steam generators. Con Edison has expressed fears that its eight-year-old Indian Point 2 plant may have to be closed for a year for repairs costing $100 million.\n\nRust has also been found in Indian Point 3, a nearly identical design, but three years newer. The Power Authority, however, has not made public its estimate of how serious the problem is.\n\nThe closing of either plant could lead to higher charges to consumers as the utilities seek replacement power and pass on the costs. A Power Authority spokesman said today, however, that he could not say definitely whether the present shutdown would mean higher charges. Most of the authority's power is sold to municipalities, including New York City and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for use by the city's subway system. Shut Since Sept. 4\n\nThe Power Authority said Indian Point 3 had been out of service since Sept. 4 for replacement of an electrical transformer outside the plant and for routine maintenance, inspections and tests.\n\nIt was originally to have returned to service yesterday. But on Sept. 23, the authority discovered a leak of what it called a small quantity of radioactive water from the plant into the Hudson River. The leak into the river was traced to the lea k in the steam generatortube.\n\nThe authority said a total of 246 gallons of radioactive water leaked from the tubing and mixed with 12,294 gallons of nonradioactive water, all of which found its way into the river along with 600 gallons of nonradioactive water used in subsequent tests. The discharge posed no threat to public health, the agency said.\n\nThe authority spokesman said leaks had occurred in steam generator tubes at Indian Point 3 on at least two previous occasions.",

It caught his eye, and him not knowing any better, he took it home and gave it to his mother. He said he didn’t want to leave it in the garbage. His mom even had a spot set up for it.”\n\nSoto said that it wasn’t until Gabriel’s mother saw the news that they knew what had happened.\n\n“When they saw where it came from, he contacted the church and I received a phone call, at about 9:30 pm,” she said. “My mother had spoken with him and informed me who he was and how he found it outside his building, which is on South 3rd Street, between Bedford and Berry.”\n\nWhen Soto’s mother talked to Gabriel, he explained that he would have never kept the statue for himself if he would’ve known how it was stolen by three thieves last Saturday.\n\n“He said, ‘We gave it a home, I just didn’t think I had to give it back so fast,'” Soto recalled. “But he said he was happy to be able to contribute to it coming back home to the church.”\n\nThe “Sacred Heart” Jesus statue is now on its way to get restored after suffering a chip on the side of Christ’s face.\n\n“We believe it happened as it landed in the garbage can,” Soto said. “They threw it in upside down. But other than that, it’s a miracle that it was just that little chip. It could of had more damage. The statue is over a hundred years old.”\n\nSoto said that even though they got the effigy back, cops will continue to try and find the culprits.\n\nSurveillance footage from the church shows a man and two women grinning and laughing as they run up to the statue and grab it before darting off.\n\n“In a moment of ignorance, they might not have been thinking the damage they were doing, and even though its back home, they should take this all in consideration and think about their actions,” Soto said. “Every action has consequence. I hope this was a life lesson for them. But to come in this morning and be able to say [the statue] came home, that alone is a real happy ending to what started off as a really sad story.”",

A gigantic sycamore tree beside the mill may be the oldest in the state.\n\nJay Phillips and Jerry Selden have recently opened a shop here, filling the first two floors of this 1847 mill with antiques, mostly American, of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nOne of their pieces, a reclining couch dating to about 1840, had been carefully restored and its top caning redone. The footboard turns upward, and the slightly raised top rail turns under in a long curl in the style of American Empire.\n\nThis mahogany piece was $2,200. A lyre-shaped mirror from the early 1800's was 40 inches high by 32 inches wide. It was carved of wood, with gesso and gilt finish. From a bouquet at the bottom, rope carving climbed the sides and ended above the mirror, and there was a fierce eagle head at each side. This was $395.\n\nIt was difficult not to notice a huge wall clock that came from ''London, Brighton and S. Coast Railway'' in Britain. In a plain oak case seven feet high, it looked ''like a big, old kitchen regulator clock,'' Mr. Phillips said.\n\nIt dated to the turn of the century and cost $2,500. An oil painting measuring 32 by 38 inches showed two golden-haired young girls in yellow and white brocade dresses cuddling a large brown dog. Painted in the mid-1800's, the faces resembled the angel faces in European paintings of the 1700's, although this one was thought to be American.\n\nIn a new frame, the painting cost $950. The store specializes in antique gas-light ceiling and wall fixtures that have been hand refinished and electrified. It also has a good selection of architectural items, such as fireplace mantels, leaded-glass windows and ornamental wood and iron pieces.\n\nOne 1890's hanging light fixture of brass combined three gas lamps alternating with three electric lamps in a day when electric power was not to be trusted. The conical-shaped shades of the electric fixtures were turned downward, while the flat, dish-shaped shades of the gas lights were turned upward. All the shades were of crimped opaline glass.\n\nThis distinctive fixture was priced at $950. A satined and leaded glass piece for $450 was most unusual in that it included 26 photographs arranged in a star shape and contained in a 14-by-15-inch frame.\n\nFamily members, in what looked like transparencies placed between glass, were clustered around an elderly couple. The woman was dressed in the style of the elderly Queen Victoria (black dress and white hair veil).\n\nThe Phillips-Selden antiques shop does restoration work on brass, lighting fixtures and furniture.

In an American Empire style, the bed was a four-poster with a foot-deep wood canopy.\n\nA tall case clock to be worked on was made by Silas Hoadley of Plymouth, Conn., around 1820. Hoadley had worked with Seth Thomas and Eli Terri of that town.\n\nThis clock has a simply made pine case, wooden works, its original dial with Hoadley's name on it and cast pewter hands. When restored, it will cost $3,000.\n\nA French gilt-bronze clock in a romantic figural style was one that Mr. Hirschmann thought to be unusual in that it retained its oval glass-dome covering and had a silk thread suspension. Silk thread, wound up or let out, regulates the speed of the pendulum, which hangs from it.\n\nAlmost 14 inches tall, the clock had a figure of a girl, seated and reading, beside the small clock face. This piece was dated to about 1865 and priced at $1,195.\n\nTall rectangular clocks in S-shaped, molded-mahogany veneer frames (referred to as ogee) were priced from $165 to $395. They were from the mid-1800's and were made principally in the Connecticut Valley. An early 1900's walnut cuckoo clock, elaborately carved in Germany's Black Forest, was $295.\n\nThe shop is open every day, except Sunday, from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M., or by appointment.

BENZA & MICHAEL LEWITTES\n\nTuesday, January 31th 1995, 3:80AM\n\nDevotees of Jackie Onassis will be thrilled to know that billionaire David Koch the proud new owner of the former first lady's 15-room co-op apartment is not going to turn the place into a state-of-the-art, full-scale bachelor pad. In fact, look for the gangly socialite and head of his own $20 billion oil services company, to turn at least one of the rooms into a shrine, so to speak.\n\nSources tell us, Koch (pronounced Coke, for the last time) has plans on converting one of the rooms possibly one of the five bedrooms into a library dedicated to the memory of Jackie O.\n\n\"This is not because he has some obsession with Jackie O, a source close to Koch told us. \"It's because he knows it's the right thing to do with a woman who was so important to this country.\"\n\nMeantime, Koch will continue to tear it up during the winter months at his home in Aspen and through the summer at his Southampton home.\n\nWe go to Il Mulino for a good veal chop, or the chance to see Vinny (The Chin) Gigante without his robe and slippers on and not talking to a parking meter. Bruce Willis dropped by Friday night for an entirely different reason.\n\nThe actor was there essentially because retired-cop-turned-private-eye Billy Stanton is the guy who asked and persuaded the actor, months ago, to shoot some public service announcements for the NYPD. The Il Mulino dinner was a chance to do the dangle with Stanton, top cop William Bratton, John Miller and China Club owner Michael Barrett.\n\nAside from picking up the heavy dinner check, Willis thrilled all the guys when he told them he was close to getting some of his big pals like Sylvester Stallone, Samuel Jackson and Henry Kissinger to lay down some PSAs of their own. It wasn't all business, though. Willis and Bratton also touched on the fact that their busy schedules make it hard to find time for their children. \"No matter where I am,\" Willis told Bratton, \"I hear my kids say 'Daddy we miss you' and I gotta fly home.\"\n\nWhy does Elton John keep getting in the middle of Sly Stallone, Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford?\n\nMonths ago, while at an Elton John dinner party in England, Gere reportedly accused Stallone of having an affair with Cindy. This time the party for the Elton John AIDS Foundation Saturday night, held at the Waldorf Astoria, was an auction and up for bids was a date with Crawford.\n\nStallone wanted to shell out bucks to go out on a date with Gere's estranged wife something Rande Gerber never had to do but the auctioneer refused any of the actor's pseudo-serious bids. Stallone was then teased by the auctioneer throughout the evening for his trying to buy a date.\n\nBut Sly wasn't the only celeb whose bids were ignored.

        "instruction": "The hackers who stole data on tens of millions of US insurance holders and government employees in recent months breached another big target at around the same time — United Airlines.\n\nUnited, the world’s second-largest airline, detected an incursion into its computer systems in May or early June, said several people familiar with the probe. According to three of these people, investigators working with the carrier have linked the attack to a group of China-backed hackers they say are behind several other large heists -- including the theft of security-clearance records from the US Office of Personnel Management and medical data from health insurer Anthem Inc.\n\nThe airline is still trying to determine exactly which data was removed from the network, said two of the people familiar with the probe. That assessment took months in the OPM case, which was discovered in April and made public in June.\n\nBesides passenger lists and other flight-related data, the hackers may also have taken information related to United’s mergers and acquisitions strategy, one of the people familiar with the investigation said.\n\nThe previously unreported United breach raises the possibility that the hackers now have data on the movements of millions of Americans, adding airlines to a growing list of strategic US industries and institutions that have been compromised. Among the cache of data stolen from United are manifests — which include information on flights’ passengers, origins and destinations — according to one person familiar with the carrier’s investigation.\n\nIt’s increasingly clear, security experts say, that China’s intelligence apparatus is amassing a vast database. Files stolen from the federal personnel office by this one China-based group could allow the hackers to identify Americans who work in defense and intelligence, including those on the payrolls of contractors. US officials believe the group has links to the Chinese government, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nThat data could be cross-referenced with stolen medical and financial records, revealing possible avenues for blackmailing or recruiting people who have security clearances. In all, the China-backed team has hacked at least 10 companies and organizations, which include other travel providers and health insurers, says security firm FireEye.\n\nThe theft of airline records potentially offers another layer of information that would allow China to chart the travel patterns of specific government or military officials.\n\nUnited is one of the biggest contractors with the US government among the airlines, making it a rich depository of data on the travel of American officials, military personnel and contractors. The hackers could match international flights by Chinese officials or industrialists with trips taken by US personnel to the same cities at the same time, said James Lewis, a senior fellow in cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n‘‘You’re suspicious of some guy; you happen to notice that he flew to Papua New Guinea on June 23 and now you can see that the Americans have flown there on June 22 or 23,’’ Lewis said. ‘‘If you’re China, you’re looking for those things that will give you a better picture of what the other side is up to.’’\n\nThe timing of the United breach also raises questions about whether it’s linked to computer faults that stranded thousands of the airline’s passengers in two incidents over the past couple of months. Two additional people close to the probe, who like the others asked not to be identified when discussing the investigation, say the carrier has found no connection between the hack and a July 8 systems failure that halted flights for two hours. They didn’t rule out a possible, tangential connection to an outage on June 2.\n\nLuke Punzenberger, a spokesman for Chicago-based United, a unit of United Continental, declined to comment on the breach investigation.\n\nZhu Haiquan, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said in a statement: ‘‘The Chinese government and the personnel in its institutions never engage in any form of cyberattack. We firmly oppose and combat any forms of cyberattacks.’’\n\nUnited may have gotten help identifying the breach from US investigators working on the OPM hack. The China-backed hackers that cybersecurity experts have linked to that attack have embedded the name of targets in web domains, phishing emails and other attack infrastructure, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.\n\nIn May, the OPM investigators began drawing up a list of possible victims in the private sector and provided the companies with digital signatures that would indicate their systems had been breached. United Airlines was on that list.\n\nIn contrast to the theft of health records or financial data, the breach of airlines raises concerns of schedule disruptions or transportation gridlock. Mistakes by hackers or defenders could bring down sensitive systems that control the movement of millions of passengers annually in the US and internationally.\n\nEven if their main goal was data theft, state-sponsored hackers might seek to preserve access to airline computers for later use in more disruptive attacks, according to security experts. One of the chief tasks of the investigators in the United breach is ensuring that the hackers have no hidden backdoors that could be used to re-enter the carrier’s computer systems later, one of the people familiar with the probe said.\n\nUnited spokesman Punzenberger said the company remains ‘‘vigilant in protecting against unauthorized access’’ and is focused on protecting its customers’ personal information.\n\nThere is evidence the hackers were in the carrier’s network for months. One web domain apparently set up for the attack -- UNITED-AIRLINES.NET -- was established in April 2014. The domain was registered by a James Rhodes, who provided an address in American Samoa.\n\nJames Rhodes is also the alias of the character War Machine in Marvel Comics’ Iron Man. Security companies tracking the OPM hackers say they often use Marvel comic book references as a way to ‘‘sign’’ their attack.\n\nThis isn’t the first time such an attack has been documented. Chinese military hackers have repeatedly targeted the US Transportation Command, the Pentagon agency that coordinates defense logistics and travel.\n\nA report last year from the Senate Armed Services Committee documented at least 50 successful hacks of the command’s contractors from June 2012 through May 2013. Hacks against the agency’s contractors have led to the theft of flight plans, shipping routes and other data from organizations working with the military, according to the report.\n\n‘‘The Chinese have been trying to get flight information from the government; now it looks as if they’re trying to do the same in the commercial sector,’’ said Tony Lawrence, a former Army sergeant and founder and chief executive officer of VOR Technology, a Columbia, Maryland-based cybersecurity firm.\n\nIt’s unclear whether United is considering notifying customers that data may have been compromised. Punzenberger said United ‘‘would abide by notification requirements if a situation warranted’’ it.\n\nFlight manifests usually contain the names and birthdates of passengers, but even if those files were taken, experts say that would be unlikely to trigger disclosure requirements in any of the 47 states with breach-notification laws.\n\nThose disclosure laws are widely seen as outdated. The theft by hackers of corporate secrets usually goes unreported, while the stealing of customer records such as Social Security numbers and credit cards is required in most states.\n\n‘‘In most states, this is not going to trigger a notification,’’ said Srini Subramanian, state government leader for Deloitte cyber risk services.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 26— President Reagan today ordered $3 billion to $6 billion in additional budget cuts after he was informed that his advisers had underestimated the growth in Federal spending for the fiscal year 1982.\n\nAt a hastily called economic briefing this afternoon, the White House announced what it said was a miscalculation in the built-in growth in the cost of government. The newly authorized reductions must be added to the $41.4 billion in budget cuts that Mr. Reagan announced on Feb. 18 if the Administration is to hold to its goal of a Federal spending ceiling of $695.5 billion in 1982.\n\nMr. Reagan's adviser on domestic policy, Martin Anderson, said ''there is no intention now'' to achieve the new reductions by cutting into the seven social welfare programs that the President spared from his original round of budget cuts.\n\nMr. Reagan learned that 1982 outlays would exceed the $695.5 estimate in an unannounced meeting with his main economic advisers and senior staff at the White House. The economic meeting apparently contributed to cancellation of a scheduled meeting of the National Security Council on the question of sending American advisers or military aid to El Salvador. That meeting was set aside until tomorrow or Friday.\n\nAt the economic meeting, Mr. Reagan was told that ''a reestimation of the numbers essentially from the ground up'' showed that 1982 spending would exceed the spending figure arrived at from budget figures inherited from the Carter Administration, Mr. Anderson said. The cost overruns were attributed primarily to Congressionally mandated growth in such social-service programs as Medicare, the health care program for the elderly that is one of the ''entitlement,'' or pledged spending, programs that Mr. Reagan promised to preserve.\n\nThe President received more favorable news today when a Federal judge in Washington upheld his freeze on Government hiring, which affects thousands of people who received job offers from the Carter Administration from Nov. 5 to Jan. 20. (Page B14.) Deeper Cuts Urged\n\nAccording to sources in the White House and the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Reagan was told that without additional cuts, the 1982 budget deficit would exceed the $45 billion he announced in his nationally televised speech last week. David A. Stockman, the Federal budget director, recommended that Mr. Reagan go for deeper cuts, even in the face of building Congressional opposition to the cuts already scheduled. ''The President accepted that in principle,'' a source in the budget office said.\n\nMr. Anderson declined to blame the Carter Administration figures directly for the cost overruns, but other Administration aides made the point privately. ''We tried to get the Carter budget early,'' a White House source said. ''We got it late and had to go with a lot of their numbers and estimates.''\n\n''It's a regrettably normal and routine overrun,'' a spokesman for the budget office said. ''The difference this time is we're not going to passive acquiescence'' and absorb the overruns by raising the deficit, as President Carter did, he said.\n\nMr. Anderson said there were several basic causes for the overruns, including inflationary growth in programs such as Medicare and more precise estimates as to the effects of cost-of-living increases in some programs. Moreover, he added, ''There were certain judgment calls where I think some of our estimates were probably less optimistic'' than the Carter Administration's.\n\nMr. Anderson asserted that the Reagan Administration's basic projections and goals for economic growth remained unchanged. He noted that the new cuts in 1982 would necessitate reductions in 1983 and 1984 beyond those already announced, if Mr. Reagan is to reach his goal of a balanced budget by 1984. However, additional cuts in the 1981 budget will be ''minuscule,'' a White House staff member added.\n\nThe White House initially declined to specify the amount of the underestimation of spending and the new budget cuts. However, it later relented and confirmed the size range of the cuts to forestall speculation that larger numbers might be involved.\n\nThe modification in figures changes Mr. Reagan's agenda for his second budget address on March 10 to the extent that he must now specify an additional $10 billion to $13 billion in spending cuts, rather than the $7 billion that was called for when the $41.4 billion spending-cut figure was in effect. Promised Further Cuts\n\nIn his Feb. 18 speech, Mr. Reagan specified $34.4 billion in cuts and promised details as to the balance of the cuts in the March 10 speech.\n\nThe economic news overshadowed the visit to Mr. Reagan today of Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet of France, and it also diverted attention from the speculation as to what course Mr. Reagan would follow in aiding the military junta governing El Salvador.\n\nMr. Reagan said yesterday that fear of the ''Vietnam syndrome'' should not prevent the United States from helping countries endangered by what he described as Communist insurrection aided by transshipments of arms from the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter talking with the President, Mr. Poncet seemed to give tacit approval of American aid to El Salvador. He said that a ''political'' rather than a ''military'' solution was needed there.\n\nIllustrations: photo of President Reagan, M.LK. Weidenbaum, and David A. Stockman",

Along with inexpensive phones, data plans need to drop.\n\nThe WSJ caught this trend at CES:\n\nDuring the holidays, Verizon Wireless offered a cheaper smartphone data plan — $15 for 150 megabits[sic] a month—to lure in new users. The offering followed AT&T’s move to tiered pricing over the summer, when it rolled out a plan charging $15 a month for 200 megabits. T-Mobile’s plan is even cheaper — $10 for 200 megabits.\n\n(note: the plans obviously call for megabytes, not megabits)\n\nWe know that Google’s GOOG Android phones are quickly heading below $100 retail (unsubsidized) but how the carriers choose to sell these phones will be the biggest factor in adoption. Luckily, the major carriers are starting to offer cheap data prices.\n\nGetting manufacturers to bring down the price is important if carriers are to cut the retail price because they subsidize smartphones heavily. Apple’s most expensive iPhone retails for $299 in the U.S., but Apple said in October it collected an average of about $610 a phone in the third quarter. Carriers make up much of the difference.\n\nA carrier doesn’t need to subsidize the cost of a $75 smartphone much (<$5/month) so customers are just paying for data, bringing costs down even further. T-Mobile’s $10/month for 200 megabytes of data may be the price point which gets a lot of featurephone users to upgrade to smartphones.\n\nAlternatively, T-Mobile’s pre-paid phone plans are its biggest growth mover. Perhaps the carriers should start to look at the model Virgin is following. Virgin offers the Samsung Intercept for around $200 unsubsidized (that will come way down in 2011). After that, users can buy unlimited plans for $25/month after taxes.\n\nCricket and other smaller carriers are experimenting with this model as well.\n\nFor me, that is the model that works best. Customers strapped for that unsubsidized phone initial cost can ‘subsidize’ it themselves with their own credit cards if they can’t cover the initial cost. With technology moving so fast, it seems shortsighted to sign up for a two year plan.",

        "instruction": "ALBANY, March 17— A State Supreme Court justice in Orange County today voided a rise in the sales tax because a State Senator who was recorded as having voted for it was not present when the vote was taken. The measure was approved last year to assist mass transit.\n\nIn ruling that the tax had never been enacted, the judge also found that the voting procedure under which most laws are passed in the Senate is inconsistent with the State Constitution ''and is repugnant to it.'' A similar procedure is used in the Assembly.\n\nThe ruling sets the stage for a possible confrontation between the legislative and judicial branches of government and could lead to changes in other laws.\n\nA court official said the tax would probably remain in effect pending an appeal, which is expected. The tax increase, one-quarter of a cent, was imposed last year in the 12 counties of the New York metropolitan area as part of a package of taxes to save the 75-cent bus and subway fare in New York City. As of February, $36 million had been collected, and about $145 million is expected from the tax next year.\n\nThe measure passed the Senate in an all-night session by a vote of 31 to 26. A minimum of 31 votes are needed for passage. The Senator in question, Howard C. Nolan Jr., Democrat of Loudonville, was listed as voting in favor of the bill. But in a deposition he said he had been in the hospital at the time for elective surgery. Also, he said, he had been opposed to the bill.\n\nIn his ruling today, Acting Justice Irving A. Green said that the ''fast roll call procedure'' under which Senator Nolan had been counted as voting in favor ''was a fiction rooted in a custom which is not expressed in the Senate rule obtaining at the relevant time, but more importantly finds no sanction in light of the constitutional mandate.''\n\nUnder the fast roll call procedure, used to expedite the thousands of bills considered by the Legislature last year, a clerk calls only the name of the first few and last few legislators.\n\nA legislator who wishes to vote ''nay'' may do so by raising a hand. All others who are recorded as present are listed as voting in the affirmative, whether or not they are present in the chamber at the time. Mr. Nolan had been in the Capitol on the morning of the vote, July 8, 1981, and had been recorded as present. Later that day, he checked into the hospital.\n\nJames J. Sweeney, the Orange County Attorney, said that the decision ''puts the question of the fast roll call procedure into severe doubt, and that is the way the vast majority of measures proceed through the New York State Senate.''\n\nOn the night the transit tax package was approved, two of the five measures were passed using a ''slow roll call'' in which members are polled individually, while three followed the fast roll call procedure.\n\nIn addition to the sales tax increase, a change in the way oil companies compute their New York State taxes passed by the 31-vote minimum, 31 to 26. Mr. Sweeney said the decision indirectly ''puts the oil receipts tax in question.''\n\nAn aide to Judge Green said that an order implementing the decision had not yet been prepared, and would probably be stayed pending an appeal. 'Custom in Both Houses'\n\nCharles Dumas, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, said: ''There is nothing unusual about the way this bill passed. Fast roll calls take place every day. It is the custom in both houses. They have been doing it for decades and centuries.''\n\nDavid Langdon, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, said he could not comment on the decision until Assembly lawyers had reviewed it. He said he ''didn't see any impact at this time.''\n\nThe office of Attorney General Robert Abrams represented the state and James H. Tully, the State Tax commissioner. Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for Mr. Abrams, said they had not seen the decision and could not comment on it or on any possible appeal. 'Would Have Voted No'\n\nSenator Nolan said the question of his vote arose because he had been marked present even though he had asked Senator Manfred Ohrentein, Democrat of Manhattan and the minority leader, to mark him absent because he intended to go into the hospital.\n\n''Senator Ohrenstein forgot to have me excused,'' he said. ''I told the Senator, 'You're lucky I'm not going to be there because I would have voted no and would have debated against the bill.' '' Senator Ohrenstein was on his way to New York tonight and could not be reached for comment.\n\nJoseph Polser, an aide to Mr. Ohrenstein, said that even if Senator Nolan had been excused, Democrats in the Senate were sure another legislator could have been found to provide the deciding 31st vote.\n\nBut Judge Green ruled that whether or not the fast roll call procedure was properly followed, the Senate rules ''make no provision for fast or slow roll call voting,'' while the State Constitution requires the ''assent'' of a majority of members of the legislative body.\n\nJudge Green quoted a dictionary definition of ''assent'' as ''to agree to something, especially after thoughtful consideration,'' and said that ''assent'' required an ''overt act'' rather than simply being recorded present in the chamber during the day. Judge Explains Ruling\n\n''The requirement of the assent of a majority of the members elected to each branch of the Legislature is not directory but mandatory,'' Judge Green wrote in his decision.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Green noted that, in general, courts have not interfered with the ''internal procedural aspects of the legislative process,'' but he said that judicial review ''may be undertaken to determine whether the Legislature has complied with constitutional proscriptions.''\n\nAides to the legislative leaders said it was probable that lawyers representing the legislators would seek to enter the case to defend the constitutionality of their procedures.",

        "instruction": "Prior to its release I was a bit skeptical of “South Park: The Stick of Truth,” the new role-playing game from Obsidian Entertainment and South Park Digital Studios, released last week for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.\n\nSure, some of the online trailers were funny, but how frequently do developers successfully pull off video games based on film or TV properties? All too often, these games are shallow, half-cocked attempts to shamelessly cash in on fans who will buy (or who developers think will buy) anything.\n\nMy skepticism was misplaced. This is a funny, fun game, and it succeeds not only because its plot captures what has made “South Park” often great over the years, but also because the gameplay is a loving, carefully constructed tribute to the role-playing games of the last 2½ decades or so.\n\nThe premise is simple. You play that source of endless speculation and wonder among elementary school kids everywhere: the new kid who has just moved to town. You quickly get pulled into a game among Cartman, Kenny, and the show’s other kids involving a power struggle over the stick of truth, which (naturally) grants the user ultimate power.\n\nOf course, “South Park” being “South Park,” this escalates beyond a simple children’s game. Before long the plot has been twisted into knotty loops by a crashed UFO, government agents, and a mysterious and sinister new Taco Bell that everyone is talking about. Things are extremely offensive throughout. We’re talking endless poop jokes, a giant Nazi fetus, copious amounts of blood spurting out of countless open wounds, a graphic sex scene, and a character creation system in which your choices are fighter, mage, thief, or Jew. If you find “South Park” offensive — and I certainly don’t blame you if you do — this game will not change your mind. It’s not surprising that various elements were censored in the EU versions.\n\nAs with the show, though, underneath all the offensiveness is a lot of cutting humor. There are hits and misses (that’s true of the show too, especially in recent years), but the former outweigh the latter. And those who have been watching “South Park” for a decade or more will be treated to many satisfying and funny appearances among the show’s sprawling cast, from the goth kids hanging out smoking behind South Park Elementary (who won’t help you out unless you don attire that projects enough ennui) to Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo (and his alcoholic, pill-popping wife).\n\nBut I anticipated the plot would be funny and true to the series; “South Park” masterminds Trey Parker and Matt Stone were, after all, very involved in the game’s production. What surprised me was how well “South Park: The Stick of Truth” works as a game, too, and the fact that it expertly captures what makes role-playing games — especially those of the Super Nintendo generation — so captivating.\n\nObsidian imbued “South Park: The Stick of Truth” with many elements and tropes from these games: a steady stream of new and better equipment, endless conversations with townspeople to find new quests, and a rapidly moving, often (endearingly) barely comprehensible plot. Combat has some tactical depth, but not so much that fighting becomes a wonky endeavour. Special attacks are explosive, often anime-influenced spectacles, such as — and here we go back to the offensiveness thing — calling upon Jesus to attack your enemies with a rapid-fire rifle, after which he dons sunglasses and leaps back to the heavens.\n\nIt all reminded me of “Final Fantasy II” and “Final Fantasy III,” games that were formative for me and a lot of others in the “South Park” generation. The developers are clearly aware of this lineage and worked hard to capture the appeal of these games and their ilk. Never is this clearer than in a wonderful late-game sequence involving the faraway, mysterious land of “Canada,” during which the developers effectively say, “Yes, we grew up playing these games, and we loved them too.”\n\nThe developers also expertly employ meta-commentary on the game itself. In one level, you find a series of audio logs (a staple of many sci-fi role-playing games) in which a character remarks mostly on why he has been wasting so much time recording audio logs rather than escaping. A late-game sword called the Sword of Endings is tagged with the description “A harbinger of things to come.” It’s good, dry humor throughout.\n\nNo one should come to “South Park: The Stick of Truth” looking for a game of endless depth and replayability. Though the developers did squeeze an impressive amount of content and customizability into the game, this is not one of those modern, open-world role-playing games that can suck up 50 or 100 hours of time. And I should point out that it was released in a buggy state. I encountered a couple of weird and annoying visual bugs, and if what I’ve read online is any indication, others experienced hiccups as well.\n\nBut overall it’s an extremely enjoyable, well executed tribute to a time when role-playing games were shorter, quirkier, and more linear — albeit one that includes a lot more farting and Nazi zombies than any “Final Fantasy” game could have gotten away with.",

Recipients of the 14th annual Trial Bar Awards were Jacob L. Balk and Alfred C. Clapp of Newark, Joseph H. Rodriguez of Camden and James I.

        "instruction": "SAN SALVADOR, Nov. 21— The spray-painted revolutionary slogans on the walls here have been scrubbed off and replaced with neatly lettered posters in the blue and white national colors telling Salvadorans: ''In 1982 your vote will make the difference. El Salvador needs your vote.''\n\nJingles on radio and television are also part of the Government's campaign to persuade people to vote in a country where for half a century the colonels and generals have insured that one of their colleagues was in the Presidential Palace.\n\nIn March, Salvadorans will elect a Constitutional Assembly. Its primary task will be to draft a constitution, but it is within the assembly's power to name the government that will run the country until the assembly decides when there will be presidential elections. This role has the most appeal to the political parties, who are filling newspapers with full-page advertisements and holding luncheons with business organizations to explain their platforms.\n\nFor the last two weeks, Salvadoran leaders have been meeting in a ''political forum'' to decide on the details of the elections, such as the date, where the polling booths will be and how voters will be registered. Rightist Offers Motion\n\nPolitical leaders from the five right-wing parties and the Christian Democrats arrive in bullet-proof vans at the complex of modern government buildings. Escorted by civilians carrying automatic weapons, men in business suits and a few conservatively dressed women hurry into the shell-shaped legislative chamber.\n\nBut before the delegates could begin their debates on details, which were televised live, the leader of one of the most conservative parties, Roberto D'Aubuisson, surprised them by offering a motion that the armed forces be petitioned to remove the Christian Democrats from the present Government. The Christian Democrats have governed since early 1980 in an alliance with the armed forces,\n\nMr. D'Aubuisson, a former intelligence officer in the National Guard, has been publicly accused by United States and Salvadoran officials of plotting a series of right-wing coups. Last April, the former American Ambassador to El Salvador, Robert White, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that there was ''compelling if not 100 percent conclusive evidence that D'Aubuisson and his group were responsible for the murder of'' Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo while he was saying mass in March 1980.\n\nAt one time, the Salvadoran Government issued a warrant for Mr. D'Aubuison's arrest. The warrant was canceled when he agreed to participate in the elections.\n\nMr. D'Aubuisson's motion was defeated by one vote when a retired general, Jose Alberto Medrano, unexpectedly sided with the Christian Democrats. General Medrano, the hero of the 1969 war against Honduras, was the founder of Orden, a rural paramilitary defense force feared by most of the country's peasants. 'Bloodless Right-Wing Coup'\n\nDespite the defeat of Mr. D'Aubuisson's motion, there are many who fear that the right will triumph. The electoral process ''is a bloodless right-wing coup,'' a priest here said last week. The priest, who asked not to be identified, suggested that after the elections the five conservative parties would form a coalition and oust the Christian Democrats.\n\nThe Acting Archbishop of San Salvador, Arturo Rivera Damas, who has called for negotiations to settle the civil war, said recently that the participation of parties representing the left was necessary before the elections could serve as a basis for resolving the political violence.\n\nThe military-civilian Government has invited the Democratic Revolutionary Front, a broad-based political group whose members include priests, dissident Christian Democrats and Trotskyists, to participate, but on condition that the party sever its links with the Farabundo Marti guerrillas.\n\nThe front's leader, Guillermo Ungo, a Social Democrat who was once a close political ally of Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat who is President of the present junta, has said it will not participate because its leaders fear they will be killed. Last November, six of the front's leaders were kidnapped while meeting in a church building; their bodies were later dumped on streets around the capital. Gloomy View of Prospects\n\nIn a statement last week, the Archbishop's Legal Aid office said that ''at the present moment there do not exist in the country the conditions to begin the electoral process.''\n\n''It does not appear that there is the necessary desire and ability to make such conditions a reality in the near future,'' the statement said.\n\nAsked if he would be a candidate, a United States-educated business leader shook his head negatively. Pointing to a photograph of his family on his office wall, he said solemnly, ''They need me.''\n\nThe businessman, who asked to remain anonymous, has received numerous death threats from left-wing groups. But now, he said, he is worried about being killed ''by anyone who wants to have the power.'' Asked if he thought the military would honor the elections, a strong expletive preceded his ''no.''\n\n''If someone is elected by the people in free, fair elections, the army will lose its power,'' he said. ''They will have to return to their barracks. They won't do that.''\n\nBut a colleague of the businessman said he thought the army would not interfere. He said that his view differed from that of his business partner perhaps because he knew the younger army officers, who he said had less to lose than their superiors if democracy came to El Salvador.\n\nSixteen years younger than his colleague, he added: ''Maybe it's just that I'm young enough to have some faith. If I didn't, I couldn't live here.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of left-wing political group members in El Salvador",

        "instruction": "Fifty years of movies have depicted World War II as period of unalloyed patriotism, with Americans marching shoulder to shoulder in the spirit of mutual sacrifice. It may have looked that way on the white side of the color line. But for African-Americans, the war ushered in one of the most bitter periods of the modern era, thanks to the policy of military segregation that barred most black soldiers from combat and poisoned relations between black Americans and the federal government.\n\nBlack volunteers who rushed to enlist after Pearl Harbor were often turned away because there were not enough all-black units to accommodate them. Those who entered the military believing that they would be taught crucial skills or sent abroad to fight found themselves confined to Jim Crow units where they built roads, loaded ships or dug latrines. Black nurses, whose numbers were kept small by a humiliating quota system, were greeted with the news that they would be permitted to treat black patients only.\n\nThe white press tiptoed around this subject. But the 300 or so papers of what was called the Negro press published front-page stories about the mistreatment of black men and women in uniform. The Pittsburgh Courier ran an explosive letter signed by black sailors who were later jailed for criticizing military apartheid and warning black men not to follow them into the service. The Negro press attacked military segregation so mercilessly that Franklin Roosevelt considered shutting down the papers.\n\nThis version of the war has been marginalized in books and largely omitted from movies. Contemporary ignorance about this period has been painfully evident in the last two weeks, since the Marvel company released the first in a series of comic books that deal head-on with the hard-core segregation that dominated World War II. The series, entitled ''Truth: Red, White and Black,'' has been derisively described as ''politically correct'' and attacked by people who do not believe that the country ever experienced an era like the one depicted in the comics.\n\nAxel Alonso, the 37-year-old series editor (who also edits Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk), has been dismayed by the depth of ignorance surrounding the subject and the fierceness with which people have attacked the project. The series focuses on the origins of Captain America, the comic book hero, clad in red, white and blue, who enjoyed enormous popularity during World War II and has been fighting crime ever since.\n\nCaptain America was originally Steve Rogers, a Depression-era baby who tried to join the Army but was rejected because he was sickly and thin. As a good American, Steve naturally volunteered to participate in an experiment by the vaunted Professor Reinstein (it rhymes with Einstein) whose secret serum turned the weakling into a well-muscled ''supersoldier,'' dressed in a costume derived from the flag. The good captain's very first issue shows him delivering a knockout punch to Hitler. He has been a popular figure in the comics ever since.\n\nThe Captain America I followed as a teenager during the 1960's was a big, brawny white guy. The Captain America who is about to be introduced to fans in the ''Truth'' series is, by contrast, very black.\n\nThe writer, Robert Morales, has apparently borrowed a page from the real history of the infamous Tuskegee experiments, and begun with the premise that the tall, blond Steve Rogers could not have been Professor Reinstein's first guinea pig. The fictional idea behind the series is that a supersoldier serum was tested first on black soldiers, who were then pushed aside when the time arrived for the Army to select a blond champion.\n\nThe story line is comic book noir at its finest. It involves a dual examination of the Captain America myth and of 40's-era racism. The opening episode offers a portrait of upper-class black life, similar to the one that came as a such a surprise to so many readers of Stephen Carter's best-selling novel ''The Emperor of Ocean Park.'' Among the lives portrayed in the series is that of an affluent black socialist named Maurice Canfield, who is arrested in an antiwar protest, tried for sedition and forced to join the Army, where he and his black barracks mates endure the humiliations appropriate to the period. The identity of the black Captain America will be revealed later in the series, but I am putting my money on Maurice.\n\nAs the embodiment of patriotism and a propaganda tool during the war, Captain America is a perfect point of departure for a re-examination of the World War II experience. The new series is selling very well, despite griping from comic insiders, who are notoriously touchy about any attempts to alter the image of a superhero. Given its healthy sales, this series could well generate a movie deal, following Spider-Man and his friends. It could also provoke a broad discussion of an era that Hollywood has largely viewed as too unpleasant to dwell upon and about which millions of readers know almost nothing.",

The aim is to make a profit from trades, much like investors do when betting on the stocks of General Electric Co or Cisco Systems Inc.\n\nAt OneSeason, users can trade real money based on the performance of athletes, teams, leagues and other sports personalities. The idea came to Sroka, 27, at his Winnetka, Illinois, high school.\n\n\"Daydreaming in my economics classroom, I mashed together my two favorite things, which were sports and trading,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.\n\nDesigned to appeal to sports fans, investors and gamblers, OneSeason allows users to build a portfolio -- the company prefers \"sportfolio\" -- of shares in athletes.\n\nThe shares, called \"synthetic ownership interests,\" are delineated with ticker symbols, just like real stocks. So Los Angeles Lakers all-star guard Kobe Bryant will have shares with the ticker \"KOBE\" when issued.\n\nThe value of those shares is determined by market demand influenced by onfield play, off-field behavior, fan opinion and future prospects, Sroka said. While OneSeason represents a first, it comes as Internet users grow comfortable with dealing in intangible assets.\n\n\"People have become much more comfortable with virtual goods and digital assets,\" Sroka added. \"In the past five years, people have also become much more comfortable with financial transactions online.\"\n\nRobert Boland, professor of sports management at New York University, said OneSeason's creation was not surprising.\n\n\"Ultimately, our entertainment, business, viewership and seeking of sports product are all converging,\" he said. \"There are people making tens of thousands off fantasy gaming and this is really just another form of that.\"\n\nThe San Francisco company will earn interest on the money in its accounts, as well as a 1 percent commission on all trades, Sroka said. There will be no advertising.\n\nAnnual revenue could hit $50 million to $100 million if OneSeason reaches 3 million users after a few years, Sroka said, adding he sees quick profits with modest traction. The ultimate potential for the website is far greater than the $800 million fantasy sports industry, he added.\n\n\"If successful, you'd have an exchange trading more issues than the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq combined,\" said Phil Drayer, chief executive of Dallas investment firm Kalydus Management, which provided Sroka with $250,000 in start-up capital. \"I see the marketplace being enormous.\"\n\nOneSeason's plan is to launch in the United States, using athletes from professional football, basketball, baseball and hockey, as well as college football and basketball. It will add sports like soccer, cricket and rugby as it expands overseas.\n\nAlso layered onto the site are elements of news, statistics and social networking.\n\nAthletes won't benefit from trading in their names, Sroka said, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that bolstered the free-speech right of any company to use the names and performance statistics of famous athletes.\n\nWith an open platform, Sroka and his backers expect a community to spring up around the website. They envision a time when users will sell analyst reports, establish brokerage services in order to short stocks and create mutual funds made up of players' shares.\n\nOneSeason, so named because users can trade any player's shares year round without being limited by a sport's calendar season, opens with trading in several players, and at least three IPOs, or Initial Player Offerings, planned daily.\n\nWhich athlete, team, league, sports agent or other sports personality is listed will be based on user demand.\n\nThe timing of the launch may not be the best, however, given a growing crisis in the U.S. financial sector and real stock markets over the last two weeks. But Sroka is confident his website will find its audience.\n\n\"The outlook for reasonably priced escapes from normal day to day life appears to be quite strong,\" he said.",

Gave $432,000 to the Foreign Press to Publish Its Views'' (May 28). v. e did not, as the article says, pay ''for supplements promoting the organization's view on aid to the third world.'' What we did was administer a trust fund set up specifically to encourage the international exchange of opinions on the continuing North-South dialogue on the world economy and its development.\n\nThis money went to reimburse papers for their newsprint costs, a not-inconsiderable factor for many of the participating publishers. In the cases of the large newspapers, the reimbursements covered only a small part of the costs to the paper. Editors who met periodically to plan forth-coming issues of the supplements were also reimbursed for their travel costs.\n\nThe implication that there was anything unethical in this is unwarranted, especially when you consider the stature of the participating newspapers and the global issues involved.\n\nThe initiative in this whole matter came from Jean Schwoebel, the former diplomatic editor of Le Monde. He had seen the governmental North-South talks held in Paris end in frustration and knew from experience that, while the issues discussed there were important, there was little understanding of them among journalists.\n\nTo remedy this and to insure an international exchange of opinion and comment, he proposed that the U.N. system and major newspapers around the world actively cooperate to bring out a quarterly supplement on North-South issues.\n\nAfter the proposal was supported by the heads of the organizations in the U.N. system, the money was raised from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation as a voluntary contribution. The U.N. role since then has been mainly of an administrative nature. Mr. Schwoebel approached the participating papers. And their editors, meeting periodically, have jointly decided on the focus and thrust of the supplements.\n\nAt their request, the U.N. system has contributed articles, and these have been clearly identified as such. Most of the articles in the supplements were written by professional journalists. No writer was paid by the U.N. or from the trust fund. The entire operation was endorsed unanimously by the 67-member U.N. Committee on Information (which included the United States).\n\nThe implication that the World Newspaper Supplement project was somehow kept from public view is not correct. We briefed the U.N. press corps when it was initiated and have kept them abreast of developments through press releases and fliers. In fact, all these facts were made available to The New York Times itself when it was asked to participate in the project.\n\nFinally, I would like to express my dismay that a paper of your reputation should carry such a slanted article as a news report. The project involves nothing more than an effort to focus media attention on a range of important and pressing problems. The integrity of the participating newspapers and of the journalists concerned is beyond question. To suggest otherwise by innuendo and implication is surely not worthy of a great newspaper.

Lawrence, Cervantes, Aeschylus and all the other weighty baggage that's been shoveled on top of the play that opened at the Cort last night. Stripped of its unstoppable name-dropping and other pretensions, Tom Griffin's ''Einstein and the Polar Bear'' is nothing more - and sometimes less - than a typically contrived romantic comedy about two lonely strangers who meet and go bump in the night. By wrapping a frivolous play in so much pseudo-literary gauze, Mr. Griffin reminds one of a high-school student who slips a ''War and Peace'' dust jacket over the trashy novel he's reading in study hall.\n\nThe star-crossed lovers of ''Einstein'' are Diane (Maureen Anderman), a New York advertising artist, and Bill (Peter Strauss), a world-famous novelist who has retired from both writing and civilization to a secluded New England town. The two meet when Diane's car breaks down on a snowy night and she invades Bill's home looking for help. You can guess the rest. Act I is a flirtatious, confessional waltz that leads to the upstairs bedroom. Act II opens with morning-after recriminations before going on to a full-fledged spat that sends one of the leads out the door in a huff. True to form, the injured party soon returns -and the curtain comes down as the hero and heroine reconcile by repeating the coy lines they spoke when they first met.\n\nThis sort of play has been entertaining before and perhaps could be again - but not as written by Mr. Griffin. His problems begin with his hero, a Gloomy Gus who sounds like no publishable novelist on earth. Bill's first sally to Diane - a typical sampling of his wit - has it that ''a beautiful bibliophile in a blizzard is ultimately better off than a dour dietitian in the desert.'' From then on, he speaks entirely in polysyllabic words (why use ''name'' when you can say ''moniker''?), Bartlett's quotations and non sequiturs. We hear of ''an insatiable garbage can,'' ''disproportionately pedestaled novelists'' and a ''mirrored restaurant reeking of hormones.'' If this man is J. D. Salinger, Jimmy Durante is Dante.\n\nOne thing is for sure - Bill isn't a character. We hear repeatedly that the emptiness of literary fame and his wife's gruesome suicide have turned him against art and life, but we never learn what kind of novels he wrote or why his wife blew her brains out. Like his highfalutin language, Bill's grave cynicism and despair seem grafted on to an otherwise conventional light-comedy hero. No wonder Mr. Strauss is lost. An intelligent, handsome television actor who's obviously at ease on the stage, he is here locked into monotonous, schoolmarmish vocal mannerisms and bitter, introspective scowls aimed at the floor.\n\nIf it's impossible to believe a word the hero says, we do at least believe in his lust for Diane. Miss Anderman is always sexy and selfpossessed in the role; one loves her just for the way she drops her jaw to express surprise at Mr. Strauss's first unexpected kiss. Yet the heroine, too, is fatally compromised by the playwright. In a last-minute plot surprise, Diane is suddenly revealed to be a real creep -and the audience feels had for having liked her for two hours. Worse still, this trick is as dishonest as it is off-putting: Though Mr. Griffin paints Diane black to show us that his hero was right, after all, to renounce the world, the playwright then moves right on to his optimistic, ''Chapter Two''-style ending, which says the exact reverse. You can't have it both ways.\n\nBut all the writing in the play is fake, starting with the title images -neither of which have anything to do with the price of bananafish. Einstein is dragged in by the hero's aged, live-in father (very well done by John Wardwell), a failing stroke victim who periodically rouses himself to tell the half-remembered story of ''the greatest day'' in his life, when he once saw Albert Einstein in a luncheonette. The only point of this recurrent business is to allow Mr. Griffin some cheap, ready-made pathos. As for the unseen polar bear, it has run away from a local zoo - or a John Irving novel - to escape civilization, as Bill has. A redundant symbol, the bear soon wears out its welcome by refusing to go to its death as quickly and quietly as Chekhov's sea gull.\n\nWe also meet a handful of loquacious townsfolk, who contribute only an irrelevant subplot and a lot of cute, overdone Yankee yammering. J Ranelli, the director, has cast these roles well, but his staging accentuates the play's artificiality: the actors often address the audience from front and center or exchange meaningful glances as subtle as laser beams. While Arden Fingerhut's winter lighting - soft for the snowy night, harsh for morning - is superb, Fred Voelpel's set is a failure. The designer hasn't solved the esthetic problem of giving Bill's busily decorated, book-laden cottage a visual focus. What we get instead is a blizzard of literary clutter that, like the fatuous writing, vainly tries to snow the audience into believing that this ''Einstein'' has a brain.

That line of thinking wrote their offerings off as training wheels for know-nothing young adults until they graduated to a grown-up, gray-haired adviser — even though these startups gathered piles of venture capital money.\n\nBut recent developments suggest the new players may be something more than the starter homes of the personal finance world.\n\nBetterment, which builds and manages investment portfolios of index and exchange-traded funds, realized 20 percent of its assets were from customers older than 50. They were asking for advice on withdrawing retirement money, and the company is introducing a service to assist them.\n\nThen there’s the index fund giant Vanguard, whose investment products are often at the heart of the portfolios these new services are building for their own paying customers. It is piloting an offering that nearly matches the new players on price while offering unlimited financial planning, along with investment management. That’s something most of the new “we’ll run your money for you” companies don’t offer.\n\nVanguard’s full-service offering, called Personal Advisor Services, costs 0.3 percent annually of the assets it’s managing. For now, customers need $100,000 in accounts there to participate, but the company plans to drop the minimum to $50,000. An existing Vanguard service that resembles the new one costs 0.7 percent annually on the first $1 million and requires at least $500,000 on balance.\n\nThis new program, which has no wait list for now but may add one if too many people sign up, may not work, though Vanguard has spent more than two years planning and testing it. But by extending both investment advice and planning to many more customers and asking them to pay less than half of what some of its other customers pay, Vanguard is all but admitting that the startups were right in identifying an enormous advice gap in the financial services industry.\n\nThe fact that so many startups have jumped into this space speaks to a problem with a basic business model that has plagued the financial advice industry for decades. Helping people sort through their investments, budgets, employee benefits, taxes, estate planning, and insurance takes time. No two clients are exactly alike.\n\nIf advisers earn their compensation through commissions from investment and insurance companies, they’re likely to favor those funds and policies. Often, this isn’t in the best interest of the customers, most of whom ought to be in low-cost index funds. And the better index funds and similar investments tend to come from companies that don’t pay commissions.\n\nCustomers can pay advisers directly, and many do pay them 1 percent each year of the money under management. But a large number of the best advisers won’t get out of bed for less than $5,000 or $10,000 annually (drawn from a $500,000 or $1,000,000 portfolio), given the amount of time and resources it takes to do right by a client. Others charge by the hour and still agree to work in a client’s best interest, but plenty of customers dislike being on the clock.\n\nSome people need no professional help. They don’t mind spending time managing their finances. They invest in the right things, don’t bail out when the markets go bonkers, and don’t have messy financial situations resulting from inheritances or disabled children or small-business tax complications.\n\nBut companies like Betterment and Wealthfront realized that many people wanted a bit of hand-holding. So they built easy-to-use sites that sought customers’ goals and risk tolerance and then put the money into a portfolio of index or exchange-traded funds. To address the question about what these random entrepreneurs know about investing, both companies cite decades of research about the right way to construct their collections of investments and rebalance customer holdings when markets rise and fall.\n\nSecurity is a slightly different question.\n\nAn event like the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff is exceedingly rare but never impossible, though thieving planners do steal money stored with well-known third-party companies, too. Some faith is necessary with any financial services startup. Yet the power of legacy brand names can allow financial service firm to collect much more in fees than they deserve.\n\nBetterment charges 0.15 to 0.35 percent of the money under management annually, while Wealthfront runs the first $10,000 without charge and then takes 0.25 percent annually after that. LearnVest takes a different approach, charging a flat setup fee plus continuing monthly fees for advice about your financial life, but it doesn’t make specific investment recommendations.\n\nVanguard casts no aspersions on either approach, and it may start a service someday that does exactly what Betterment and Wealthfront do. Though its origins are in helping people make their own decisions, it’s now reacting to the growing number of calls from people who don’t know whether they’ve saved enough and aren’t sure how to start spending what they have saved.\n\n“They are increasingly saying, ‘How can you help me in more of an ongoing advisory capacity?’ ” said Karin Risi, a Vanguard principal in advice services and asset management. “This is a big investment and a big aspirational move to say, ‘Yes, we want to help many more clients.’ ” Vanguard plans to move customers who are paying 0.7 percent annually for their advice into the new, less expensive service before long.\n\nWhile many traditional financial planners are crossing their fingers and hoping no all-out price war breaks out, there is some pricing innovation around the edges.\n\nNew is a service called XY Planning Network. Michael Kitces, a cofounder, had long observed an intense frustration among his younger peers who couldn’t afford to serve average people in their 20s and 30s without pushing bad investments and inappropriate insurance on them. The network will pair consumers with planners who are willing to work on a monthly retainer and make money only from the fees they charge their customers. The network is considering teaming up with Betterment to handle investments so its planners can focus on all of the other aspects of their customers’ financial lives.\n\nThat potential pairing suggests the possibility all of these services are, in fact, complementary and not competitive, but you wouldn’t know it by viewing a hysterical video making the rounds in the industry. Set to spooky music, it warns consumers about robo-advisers and reminds them “you are a person, not a number; you’re an individual, not an algorithm.”\n\nStill, Betterment and Wealthfront can have their algorithms help run portfolios, and human advisers at LearnVest and XY Planning Network and the more traditional financial planning and wealth management firms can hold the hands of beginners and help people as their financial lives get more complex. Vanguard will try to do it all without charging very much, and other brand-name companies will no doubt jump in.\n\nNot all of these players will survive, but the sheer number of them will probably bring prices down or force established advisers to do more to justify their fees. As long as nobody runs off with the money, consumers stand to gain over the long term from all of the people now clamoring to do the best job of helping them out.",

        "output": "For a couple of years, a number of entrepreneurs have been racing to solve the same problem: the financial services industry’s persistent inability to provide personalized advice and appropriate investments at a reasonable price to customers who are not rich. At first, it was easy at first for established players to dismiss companies like Betterment, Wealthfront, and LearnVest as robo-advisers, niche services, or certain failures. That line of thinking wrote their offerings off as training wheels for know-nothing young adults until they graduated to a grown-up, gray-haired financial adviser — even though these startups gathered piles of fancy venture capital money. But recent developments suggest the that those new players may be something more than the starter homes of the personal finance world."

        "instruction": "NORMAN PARK, Ga. LESS than 15 minutes after our two English setters had been turned loose to hunt in an open stand of stately, longleaf pines on a sunny hillside, they were locked on point.\n\nThe owner of the dogs - Charley Dickey of Tallahassee, Fla. - and I moved in, guns at ready. I was pleased when the lone quail the setters had located took off on Mr. Dickey's side.\n\nI was pleased because I felt strangely awkward, not yet ready for the swift movements needed in successful quail shooting. My companion downed his bird with one shot and twice more within a few minutes repeated his performance. The third bird had flown straight away from us and I knew that both Mr. Dickey and our guide, John Norman, were wondering about my failure to shoot at it.\n\n''Nelson,'' said Mr. Dickey, ''you can be too much of a gentleman in quail shooting. Don't hold off on a shot that is just as much yours as mine.''\n\nI replied that my restraint was born of something else, that I needed a little time to recapture the essence of the endeavor. It had been several years since I had visited one of Georgia's many magnificent quail plantations (and here, the 4,000-acre Quailridge is one of them). That, plus the odd sensation created by traveling from the cold of the Northeast to a place where the temperature was in the low 80's by noon and redbud trees were putting out their lavender blooms, was a bit overwhelming.\n\nThere soon came a time when a covey of birds that erupted from the wire grass at my feet were indisputably mine to shoot. I shot and they continued on unscathed. It had been an easy opportunity, but I knew, as I fired, that I hadn't mounted the gun properly.\n\nMy next opportunity was a difficult one on a bird rocketing off to my right and it fell. My companions, who had remained silent on my previous miss, complimented me, and I entertained a vague notion that my form had returned.\n\nBy the end of the next two hours -we quit at 11 because it would have been both cruel and stupid to run the dogs any longer in the blazing sunshine - we had taken 19 quail, five short of our basic two-man limit of 24. Most of them had fallen to Mr. Dickey's gun, but that didn't trouble me because quail hunting is a passion to which he frequently succumbs. (For a delightful exposition of that passion, which also involves a fascination with the birds themselves and the dogs that find them, read Mr. Dickey's ''Bobwhite Quail Hunting,'' published by Oxmoor House.)\n\nWe returned to the field in the middle of the afternoon after the day's heat had eased off - this time Edwin Norman, John's father, also accompanied us - and quickly shot the five more birds to which we were entitled.\n\nThe Normans are a father-son team. Edwin Norman, who is also a field trial judge, comes from a long line of Georgia farmers, and his son is a graduate zoologist.\n\n''We raise corn, peanuts, tobacco, soybeans, milo, hogs, beef cattle, quail, bird dogs and children,'' Edwin Norman said to me as we drove to one of our shooting areas in a Jeep that is equipped with a raised seat in back from which hunters may more easily watch the dogs work. ''We're not making much money but we have a good time and a first-class plantation.''\n\nAs on all shooting preserves, most of the quail on the Normans's spread are pen-raised, because it would be impossible for native populations of the bird to provide hunting throughout the season. Some hunters feel that wild, or native, quail hunting is much more difficult, that the birds are both more wary and better flyers. There is truth in this, but if the released birds are properly raised from good stock there is often very little difference, if any. There is also some mating between the released and wild birds, which further blurs the distinction.\n\nQuail hunting on a top-notch plantation is not cheap. The rates at Quailridge are slightly below the average. A full day's hunting, including meals, lodging, guide and dogs and a 12-bird bag, costs $225 at Quailridge, or if one plans to arrive and leave the same day, $190 for the shooting and a noon meal.\n\nThe preserve season for quail is Oct. 31 through March in Georgia. Quailridge is in southwestern Georgia, about 17 miles northeast of the Moultrie Airport. Hunters flying in to Moultrie or to Albany, 40 miles northwest of Quailridge, may make arrangements to be picked up.\n\nThe hunting lodge at Quailridge is a converted farmhouse that has a five-acre pond out front stocked with largemouth bass, bream and shellcrackers. During the noon break or in the early morning or evening hunters are free to fish that pond or any of the others, more than a dozen, situated on the plantation.\n\nThe Normans do not handle large hunting parties and do most of the guiding themselves. This, says Edwin, enables them to give personal service to their clients. Most bookings are made well in advance. The telephone numbers are (912) 769-3201 or 985-5011, and the address is Quailridge, Box 155, Norman Park, Ga. 31771.\n\nMost of Quailridge's dogs are pointers, which, at some risk of offending champions of other breeds, are generally considered to be the classic bird dog of the South.\n\nHunters who wish to do so may bring their own dogs and the Normans will board and train a limited number of dogs each year for $125 a month.\n\nAmong the pleasures of visiting quail plantations are the evening chats with other hunters who are almost always a warm and friendly lot and who - perhaps inspired by a toddy or two - often reveal more of themselves at such gatherings than they would on home territory. Gestures of friendship to a just-made acquaintance are not uncommon.\n\nI, for example, confess that while I would never know what it was like to own and farm a thousand acres, I got great pleasure from maintaining a vegetable garden 100 feet by 100 feet.\n\nThis prompted William Brodbeck of Hilton Head, S.C., to ask if I was acquainted with the glories of the Vidalia onion. I said no, and he, ardently supported by Edwin Norman, said it was a magnificent thing, tasty and so mild it could be eaten like an apple.\n\nWhere, I asked, could I find seeds or sets for this marvel? Mr. Brodbeck rose from the table, went outside and returned in a few moments with a handful of onion sets. ''These are Vidalias,'' he said. ''I bought these on the way down. You take them and plant them as soon as you can.'' He then went on to describe in detail the depth at which they should be planted and the care that should be given them when the tops begin to fall over.\n\n''Begin eating them when they reach a suitable size,'' he added, ''for they are not good keepers.'' They are before me now, wrapped in paper towels, and a gentle, elusive scent comes from them, reminding me of Quailridge and good dogs on point and good friends I hope to meet again.\n\nIllustrations: drawing of a quail",

        "instruction": "After being exonerated by the Justice Department and declared clean as a hound's tooth by the White House counsel, longtime Reagan loyalist Richard Allen was asked to step down as national security adviser. The reason given him was that he would continue to be a target for the press and the House Democrats.\n\nComing from a President who has kept on William Casey and David Stockman despite the same likelihood of flak, that is not credible. The real reason is that the notion of downgrading the office of national security adviser has flopped and Ed Meese needed a scapegoat.\n\nAs pointed out here months ago (''Of Meese and Men''), the failure of foreign policy formulation lay on the peripatetic Mr. Meese's doorstep: by interposing himself as the all-round issues guru for both domestic and foreign policy, he was hamstringing the N.S.C. and demoralizing its staff.\n\nThe brouhaha over Mr. Allen's mental lapse after intercepting an envelope containing $1,000 provided Mr. Meese, whose power is ebbing as his political yearnings turn westward, with a convenient excuse for correcting his original decision about lines of authority without admitting error. The appointment of a new man meant that a new system could be put in without loss of face by any member of the Troika.\n\nThe selection of William Clark, who has served as Mr. Reagan's ambassador to Al Haig for the last 11 months, is being described as a significant ''upgrading'' of the national security adviser's job and as a change of White House leadership from Troika to Quartet. It is neither.\n\nYes, the new national security adviser will personally brief President Reagan without the accompaniment of other bureaucrats, an opportunity denied Mr. Allen. In the case of a foreign policy expert, such unimpeded proximity is power. But in the case of an admitted non-expert, the question becomes quis instruet ipsum instruc-torem? - who will brief the briefer?\n\nMr. Clark is an intelligent and quietspoken fellow whose virtues are now being extolled by accommodationists whose phone calls his predecessor refused to return; although only newly versed in for eign affairs, he i s expected to use his talents as a mediator to adjudicate di sputes between Secretaries Haig and Weinberger. He is there to spli t differences, and not to overlay a weltanschauung that used to be a requirement of the job.\n\nThe ''upgrading,'' such as it is, does not deal with substance; thenational security adviser will pass along bri efings but will not really advise; no conceptual frameworker with a memory of Soviet duplicity will offset the growing dominance o f the detente-firsters at State.\n\nThe Meese-used Mr. Allen is being derogated as no great strategic brain, but when he warned of the ''wave of pacifism'' in Europe last spring, he was derided by the very pundits and cookie-pushers who now realize how right he was. His ouster means that hard-lining has been downgraded, and that Haigian power plays will go unrecognized.\n\nTake the ''Scowcroft ploy,'' for example. No sooner had Mr. Clark been introduced as Mr. Foreign Policy at the White House than State sources leaked word that Brent Scowcroft was the leading candidate to be appointed Secretary Haig's emissary to the Israeli-Egyptian autonomy talks. That was a deception; General Scowcroft had not been asked, and his Arab business associations would present such a clear conflict of interest that he would almost surely decline. The intent may have been to bestir Jewish leaders to protest, enabling State to avoid appointing anyone until after the return of the last third of Sinai in April.\n\nAnother White House balloon that deserves deflating is the notion that the Troika - Messrs. Meese, Deaver and Baker - is now to change to a Quartet, four equal barbers singing in harmony. The fact is that two of them are afflicted with terminal lame-duck@yness: Mr. Meese is advertising his California political availability and Mr. Deaver is either advertising for clients or getting ready to leave lest he be asked the same questions he demanded be asked of Mr. Allen.\n\nIn effect, President Reagan now has two chiefs of staff, one dealing with domestic affairs, the other with foreign affairs, and neither with an institutional memory of Reaganautics. The trouble with jettisoning an adviser who cast his lot with you at the start - especiallly after he has been cleared of wrongdoing - is that you send a troubling signal to all others who were with you in those hungry days on the outside, causing ''true believers'' within your Administration to wonder if their own hard-earned credentials are still valid. It also forces early rooters on the outside to wonder if the principles you once fearlessly espoused are not being abandoned, as you carefully conserve your political capital.\n\nPerhaps he was persuaded that Mr. Allen's presence made him politically vulnerable, or perhaps he felt guilty at the graceless way he let a loyalist dangle, but the result of the scapegoating is that Ronald Reagan is the only card-carrying hard-liner in the White House with access to the Oval Office.",

        "instruction": "HAPPY NEW YEAR: FIVE THINGS TO WATCH FOR – IN 2012\n\n1) IRAN & THE BOMB…Already in this young year, Iran has test-fired long-range missiles, announced the completion of a nuclear fuel rod, and threatened to shut down the oil-crucial Strait of Hormuz. But the huge questions – perhaps unmatched by any other global security challenge for 2012: What can or will the world do to stop Iran from acquiring the bomb? Will Israel go after the Iranian nuclear program? And – if so – what will the White House do?\n\n2) EUROPE – ON THE BRINK…How dangerous is Europe’s financial mess? It’s indisputably the continent’s worst crisis since World War II – and for an updated forecast look no further than German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s New Year’s message. Saying that Europe was facing its “harshest test in decades,” Merkel warned that “next year will no doubt be more difficult than 2011.” Leading economists polled by the BBC see a new recession in Europe in the first half of 2012. And of all the global crises, this is the one most likely to affect President Obama’s reelection chances. It gets that much harder to create American jobs – if and when European demand dries up.\n\n3) RUSSIAN “SPRING”?…Will Vladimir Putin roll right over the growing opposition movement in his country? That’s what we all thought a year ago – when the leaders in question were Mubarak and Gadhafi. True reform in Russia – or a well-managed succession – would be good news for the U.S. and the rest of the world. A messy or violent transition could of course be hugely destabilizing for Russia, its neighbors and the world.\n\n4) SYRIA – HOW WILL IT END?…The longest-running and most violent installment of the “Arab Spring” continues to confound the predictions. On the one hand, it’s hard to see how Bashar al-Assad rides out the storm; on the other, it’s very hard to see how a fractured opposition wins a revolution with only tepid support for outside intervention. Christiane Amanpour’s interviews with Mubarak and Gadhafi were the last for those dictators; will Barbara Walters’ interview with Assad be that leader’s last?\n\n5) PAKISTAN – FRIEND AND FOE…Want a tidy end to the Afghan war? A regional peace? A bulwark against terrorism? The terrible paradox of Pakistan is that it contributes in each case to both the problem and the solution. And today the relationship with Washington is at a low point. What happens when an attack on a U.S. target is traced to a Pakistan-based group?\n\nMEANWHILE – IN THE DAY’S NEWS…\n\nIran test-fired a surface-to-surface cruise missile on Monday during a drill that the country’s navy chief said proved Tehran was in complete control of the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the passageway for one-sixth of the world’s oil supply. The missile, called Ghader, or Capable in Farsi, was described as an upgraded version of a missile that has been in service before. The official IRNA news agency said the missile “successfully hit its intended target” during the exercise. An earlier version of the same cruise missile had a range of 124 miles (200 kilometers) and could travel at low altitudes. There were suggestions it could counter the U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf. Iran’s 10-day navy drill, which ends Tuesday, was Tehran’s latest show of strength in the face of mounting international criticism over its nuclear program. “The Strait of Hormuz is completely under our control,” Iran’s navy chief Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said after Monday’s test. “We do not allow any enemy to pose threats to our interests.” State TV showed footage Monday depicting the launch of two missiles, which were fired into the sky and which the TV said could hit targets “hundreds of kilometers (miles) away” from the point of origin. The broadcast said two more missiles, with a shorter range, were also tested Monday. “We conducted the drill … to let everybody know that Iran’s defense and deterrence powers on the open seas and the Strait of Hormuz are aimed at defending our borders, resources and our nation,” said Sayyari, the navy chief.\n\nCriticism continues of the soft approach of the Arab League mission in Syria. Today the League Secretary-General said Syria’s military has withdrawn from residential areas and is on the outskirts of the country’s cities, but gunfire continues and snipers are still a threat. The United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed in a crackdown on protests which broke out against Syrian President Bashar Assad in March. Arab League chief Nabil Elbaraby was speaking in Cairo as Arab League monitors gathered in Syria to check compliance with a peace plan. He said the League would report on the work of the monitors over the first week and decide if more were needed there.\n\nEGYPT: MUBARAK ON TRIAL – ON A GURNEY\n\nThe trial of Hosni Mubarak has resumed amid speculation that a recent acquittal of policemen tried for killing Egyptian protesters could be a prelude to the dismissal of charges against the ousted leader. Mubarak faces charges of complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during last year’s uprising that toppled his regime. The 83-year-old Mubarak was brought by helicopter to the Cairo courthouse on Monday from a hospital. He was then taken into the defendants’ cage on a gurney, wearing dark sunglasses and covered by a green blanket. A Cairo court on Thursday acquitted five policemen of charges of killing five protesters during the Jan. 25-Feb. 11 uprising.\n\nIRAQ: PM WARNS AGAINST ‘EXCESSIVE JOY’ OVER U.S. DEPARTURE\n\nThe Associated Press reports Iraq’s prime minister has called for unity and greater political stability to ensure the country’s security after the end of the American military presence. Speaking at a televised celebration in Baghdad, Nouri al-Maliki warned Iraqis against “excessive joy” over the departure of American troops, saying the country’s security situation remains perilous. The last U.S. combat soldiers left on December 18.\n\nMIDEAST NEGOTIATORS TO MEET FOR FIRST TIME IN OVER A YEAR\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians said Sunday that their chief peace negotiators would attend a gathering of international diplomats in neighboring Jordan this week, bringing the sides together for the first time in more than a year.\n\nBIRD FLU – SHOULD WE WORRY?\n\nThe strain of H5H1 bird flu that killed a Chinese man cannot spread among people, a health agency said Monday, appealing for calm after the country’s first reported case of the disease in humans in 18 months. Genetic analysis indicated the virus spread directly from poultry to the victim, who died Saturday in the southern city of Shenzhen, the Shenzhen Disease Control Center said in a statement reported by the official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nNIGERIA: FURY OVER FUEL COSTS\n\nTough way to start the New Year: Nigerians saw the price of gas and public transportation double overnight after the government announced yesterday it is ending a decades-old fuel subsidy. People took their anger to President GoodLuck Jonathan’s Facebook page, gas stations closed throughout the country fearing backlash, and trade unions have vowed to organize citizens in a massive nation-wide boycott. The subsidy costs Nigeria $8.5 billion per year and the IMF has said for years that it is not economically sound for Africa’s most populous nation. But Nigerians argue, in a country which is one of the world’s largest oil exporters and where billions of dollars have been lost to corruption, having cheap fuel is the only benefit average citizens get from living in the oil-producing state.\n\nWORLD’S BEST-PAID SOCCER STAR STARTS CELL NETWORK\n\nFrom Dana HUGHES: Samuel Eto’o, a soccer player from Cameroon who recently signed a historic contract paying him more than $28 million dollars a year to play for a Russian team, has launched a new mobile network in his native Cameroon. Set’Mobile has already sold more than 50,000 SIM cards ahead of the network’s official activation on January 21, which is the opening day of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations soccer tournament. Eto’o says he wants to provide a low-cost alternative to Orange and MTN, the multi-national companies currently operating in the country. Africa is the fastest-growing cellphone market in the world, but Cameroon lags behind its neighbors. Analysts say Set’Mobile will not increase mobile network penetration in the country, but is a smart business venture for the soccer player.\n\nUSA Today suggests foreign tourists could do wonders for the U.S. economy: Agustina Ocampo is the kind of foreign traveler businesses salivate over. The 22-year-old Argentine recently dropped more than $5,000 on food, hotels and clothes in Las Vegas during a trip that also took her to Seattle’s Space Needle, Disneyland and the San Diego Zoo. But she doubts she will return soon. “It is a little bit of a headache,” said Ocampo, a student who waited months to find out whether her tourist visa application would be approved. More than a decade after the federal government strengthened travel requirements after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, foreign visitors say getting a temporary visa remains a daunting and sometimes insurmountable hurdle. The tourism industry hopes to change that with a campaign to persuade Congress to overhaul the State Department’s tourist visa application process. “After 9/11, we were all shaken and there was a real concern for security, and I still think that concern exists,” said Jim Evans, a former hotel chain CEO heading a national effort to promote foreign travel to the U.S. At the same time, he said, the U.S. needs “to be more cognizant of the importance of every single traveler.”\n\nFrom Akiko FUJITA in Tokyo: Japan’s population fell by 204,000 to 126.24 million, the largest decline since the end of World War II. The country’s population has been declining rapidly over the years, spurred by the world’s largest aging population, but the Health Ministry said yesterday, the decline this year was the largest since 1947. The number includes the more than 15,000 killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami. The estimated number of newborns fell to a record-low 1.05 million – down 14,000 from last year.\n\nFUJITA again: The Japanese set yet another Twitter record at midnight, New Year’s Day – when they sent out a record 16,197 tweets per second. The tweet overload caused the system to crash momentarily. The Japanese set several twitter records in 2011: first with the tsunami, then right after women’s soccer World Cup win. The Japan Times reports Japanese users recorded an incredible 25,088 tweets per second in December – nearly 3 times higher than the former record, set when Beyonce announced her pregnancy. The tweets last month were related to a classic Japanese anime film, that aired nationwide on TV.\n\nMEANWHILE, A FAMOUS NEW TWEETER\n\nRupert Murdoch, 80, joins the crowd. As the Telegraph writes — “No hacking required…” Not a smart move, though, to tweet about the folly of long vacations — and do so from St. Bart’s.",

        "instruction": "DESPITE efforts by the Reagan Administration to eliminate Title I as a distinct program, the nation now has a new, streamlined version of the much-acclaimed compensatory-education system.\n\nDesigners of the new Chapter I, as it is now known, are convinced that it will be a vast improvement on the previous version, which was created in 1965 as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. They argue that it will allow greater flexibility, encourage innovation, eliminate unnecessary paperwork and, as the legislation puts it, ''free the schools of unnecessary Federal supervision, direction and control.''\n\nCritics, though, contend that some of these reforms could eventually undermine the Government's best-known and, in the view of many, most effective program for disadvantaged children. ''There will be a major impact,'' asserted Representative Carl D. Perkins, the Kentucky Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. ''The program will not be as effective as it has been or as it should be.''\n\nThe fact that the program still exists is something of a story in itself. As part of its effort to cut Federal spending and diminish the Federal presence in education, the White House sought to merge the funding of programs for children with special needs -the disadvantaged, handicapped, bilingual and others - into a general, largely unrestricted ''block grant'' to the states and then reduce its overall budget by 25 percent. This plan, however, ran up against instant and bipartisan opposition in both houses of Congress.\n\nThe Administration had clearly underestimated the extent to which a number of key Republicans and Democrats were committed to the concept of Title I. In July 1980, before the Presidential election, John M. Ashbrook, the Ohio Republican who is the ranking member of the House committee, introduced a bill providing for a separate program for the disadvantaged that eventually emerged with some changes as the 1981 Education Consolidation and Improvement Act.\n\n''I told the Administration, 'We'll pretty well accept your target on dollars but don't tell us how to do it, and don't try to rewrite a whole education program,' '' Mr. Ashbrook recalled. Senator Robert T. Stafford, the Vermont Republican who heads the Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts and Humanities and who led the fight for Title I in the Senate, agreed.\n\n''This is a classic case where I thought about the country as well as my own state, and Title I is clearly important for the country,'' he said.\n\nAlthough about 30 other educational programs were eventually consolidated into block grants, the lawmakers had doubts about this concept as applied to Title I. Senator Stafford said that it would produce a situation in which ''the handicapped and the disadvantaged would be fighting each other for a diminished piece of Federal assistance.''\n\nCharles W. Radcliffe, minority counsel and staff director of the House committee, explained, ''The Administration looked at the process in the abstract, and block grants make sense in the abstract. But we looked at it programmatically and politically.''\n\nAnother factor in the continued bipartisan support for Title I is its demonstrated effectivness. Despite some initial poor findings and early unsophisticated evaluation efforts, there is substantial evidence not only that Title I funds reaches the targeted population, which includes disadvantaged children in both public and private schools, but that it also leads to educational results.\n\nIn 1979, the National Institute of Education reported that Title I funds were, as the law required, ''supplementing'' rather than ''supplanting'' local funds and that Title I provided significantly more money to low-income districts than did other state and Federal programs.\n\nMore recently, the National Assessment for Educational Progress reported that in the years 1970 to 1980 the performance of 9-yearolds in the Southeast on reading tests - the focus of three-quarters of Title I projects - had improved by 7.5 percent. In rural areas and disadvantaged urban areas performance rose by 6 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. Across the nation, black 9-year-olds made the most significant gains of all: 9.9 percent.\n\n''We've seen significant gains in achievement in the inner city,'' said Thomas C. Rosica, executive director of Federal programs for the Philadelphia schools, who is also chairman of the staff Legislative Committee of the Council of Great City Schools. ''We've been able to stop the regression; there are gains at all levels.''\n\nSuch findings bear out the intention of the builders of Title I. ''Title I put the matter of educationally deprived kids on the agenda of the nation's schools,'' said Harold Howe 2d, the Commissioner of Education during its early years.\n\nWith its effectiveness documented, supporters of the new legislation argued successfully that the time had now come to streamline Title I. ''The thrust of the original Title I was innovation,'' said Mr. Ashbrook. ''Little by little that goal was lost.'' He and others thus proposed a series of reforms, many of which found their way into the new legislation.",

        "instruction": "Governor Charlie Baker’s plan to make Massachusetts utilities buy hydroelectricity from Canada would raise prices and wreak havoc on the region’s power markets, the New England Power Generators Association has charged.\n\nThe group paid for Sue Tierney, a former Massaschusetts secretary of environmental affairs, to study Baker’s proposal to meet emissions targets by having National Grid and Eversource Energy buy low-cost electricity from Canadian dams and other sources. Tierney said Baker’s proposal was “too risky” and would increase costs.\n\nIn Vermont, Tierney wrote, Hydro Quebec signed a 26-year contract in 2011 to sell power at a price that is now about the market price for electricity in New England. The need to build transmission lines and the likelihood that Canadian power companies would charge the market rate for electricity -- despite the cheap cost of generating hydropower -- would add about $777 million in extra annual costs for Massachusetts residents, Tierney said.\n\n“It’s just inconceivable to me that there could be cheap power from Canada, delivered into New England, without that being higher than what electricity prices are today,” Tierney said in an interview. “It’s unlikely to be a good deal for Massachusetts consumers in the long run, with that amount of surplus power.”\n\nTierney’s report also tried to downplay one of Baker’s main motivations for drawing in electricity from Canada: meeting aggressive greenhouse-gas reductions established in state law. She said the power plant sector is already on target to meet its goal of a nearly 8 percent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions from 1990s levels by the year 2020. (The state goal is a 25 percent decline by 2020, but the power plant sector is expected to account for one-fourth of that drop.)\n\nTo be sure, the power generators’ group has a financial interest in keeping hydropower generators out of the New England market. They have invested billions in their plants, and advocates for hydropower say imports could bring down the market price for electricity and hurt those companies’ bottom line. But the power plant owners have said changing the market rules to sign hydroelectricity contracts would send an unsettling signal to domestic electricity companies, discouraging future investment.\n\nBaker’s administration isn’t backing down. Katie Gronendyke, a Baker energy and environment spokeswoman, said the administration’s hydro push would be “cost-effective for ratepayers and environmentally conscious.”\n\n“The administration has prioritized reducing and stabilizing the rising cost of energy for consumers and remains committed to pursuing innovative opportunities to ensure a diversified energy portfolio, including both solar and hydropower,” she said in a statement.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 23— He looks and sounds like an urbane Washington lawyer. Dark pin-stripe suit. Graying mustache. Neatly cropped black hair. He argues points with cool eloquence, parrying questions he'd rather not answer, like the questions about why his leaders publicly applauded the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt.\n\nDr. Hatem I. Hussaini is the Palestine Liberation Organization's man in Washington. He is also a member of its legislative body, the Palestine National Council. The visage grinning through a ragged beard from the wall of his spacious, well-appointed office is that of Yasir Arafat, whom he calls ''my chairman.''\n\nDr. Hussaini says his job is to talk to the American people, to tell them that he and more than four million other Palestinians loyal to the P.L.O. ''have suffered a great tragedy'' at the hands of Israel - that they are not terrorists, hijackers or fanatics determined to drive the Jews into the sea, not Communist tools of the Soviet Union. Recent Days Have Been Busy\n\nThe last few days have been busy ones for the 40-year-old native of Jerusalem. First there were the interviews about the Sadat murder, then the statements by former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter that the United States would eventually have to negotiate with the P.L.O.\n\nDr. Hussaini called these statements ''significant.'' ''I wish that they had said this when they were in power,'' he added. President Reagan, Dr. Hussaini noted, has reaffirmed his predecessors' policy of refusing to talk to P.L.O. officials so long as the organization refuses to recognize Israel.\n\nAsked why the P.L.O. has refused to recognize Israel, Dr. Hussaini offered the familiar rejoinder: ''It is because the Palestinians have no state, and usually recognition is between states. It is not the Palestinians who must recognize Israel, it is the Israelis who must recognize the Palestinians.''\n\nThe United States has also refused to allow P.L.O. representatives from overseas to travel in the United States to give speeches promoting their cause. But as a resident alien who has lived in the United States since 1962, Dr. Hussaini has a constitutional right to travel around the country giving lectures to those, including members of Congress, who will listen to him.\n\nHis status in Washington is somewhere between public relations man and diplomat. He is a member of the Council of Arab Ambassadors. He says he also meets with diplomats from the Soviet Union, India, Yugoslavia and from some Latin American and African nations sympathetic to the P.L.O.\n\n''Socially it sometimes happens that I see one or two officials of the State Department,'' Dr. Hussaini said. ''They just say hello. I say hello. But there is no official contact, which I feel is ridiculous.''\n\nDr. Hussaini says he has met with members of Congress, including Representative Paul Findley, Republican of Illinois, and Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon.\n\nThis weekend he is speaking to student groups at two campuses of the University of Arizona. He has also spoken in the past year at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of North Carolina, to name a few institutions, and occasionally to church groups.\n\n''I think it has been very fruitful, although there is lots of agony and pain in it,'' Dr. Hussaini said of his work. He said Palestinians had been ''subjected to ugly stereotyping,'' as in a recent radio talk show in which a caller told him Mr. Arafat was ''a snake, a cutthroat.''\n\nAnd eight months ago the owners of the building where his offices had been situated told him to get out after an unexploded bomb was found.\n\nDoes he feel shunned because of the P.L.O.'s image? ''No, not at all,'' Dr. Hussaini replies. ''I've found the American people in the last three years open-minded, willing to listen.''\n\nThe P.L.O. pays about $200,000 a year, according to Justice Department records, to cover the expenses of the Palestine Information Office. These include salaries for six employees, the cost of publishing pamphlets and a monthly magazine called Palestine Perspectives, travel and rent for a suite in a building on Wisconsin Avenue north of Georgetown.\n\nDr. Hussaini calls himself a refugee, a man without a country. ''My story is the typical story of all Palestinians,'' he says. His father was a professor, a man of letters. He remembers that when the Israeli forces entered West Jerusalem in 1948, the family fled to Aleppo, Syria, leaving his father's 40,000 books and everything else. They hoped to go back when things returned to normal. Things never did.\n\nHe grew up in Beirut, went to Cairo, where he was educated at American University, then came to the United States and obtained his doctorate in political science at the University of Massachusetts. After teaching at Smith College, he came to Washington to work for the League of Arab States, then opened the Palestine Information Office in 1978.\n\n''Israel has had a monopoly here over information for a long time,'' Dr. Hussaini said in an interview. ''It's about time we were heard equally.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Dr. Hussaini",

Walt Disney World doesn’t want you to know, and the actors who play Disney characters at the parks say that’s a violation of their constitutional rights.\n\nA union representing actors who portray Mickey, Goofy, and other characters filed a complaint Friday with the National Labor Relations Board, challenging a policy that it says prevents the performers from revealing which animated figures they portray.\n\nTeamsters Local 385 said in the complaint that Disney was committing an unfair labor practice. A grievance filed last week with the company said the two-week-old written policy prevents actors from publicly revealing in social media or traditional media which characters they play.\n\nViolations could lead to disciplinary action, including firing, said Donna-Lynne Dalton, recording secretary for the Teamsters local. So far, she said, none of the 1,200 character actors at Disney World have faced disciplinary action.\n\n‘‘The performers are very concerned because you can’t un-tell somebody something,’’ Dalton said. ‘‘They have family and friends that already know this and have pictures of themselves in their performing roles. It’s out there.’’\n\nThe confidentiality policy had been a subject of negotiations during past contract talks, but it never made it into a contract, union officials said.\n\n‘‘The company doesn’t have the right to control social media postings,’’ said Mike Stapleton, president of the Teamsters local. ‘‘Suddenly the company wants to pretend there aren’t people behind those costumes and the Constitution doesn’t extend to the theme park.’’\n\nDisney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said the company has always expected the performers not to reveal their identities.\n\n‘‘We’re proud of the role characters play in guest experience,’’ Wahler said. ‘‘This is in line with our longstanding expectation for cast members to uphold character integrity.’’\n\nDisney has always discouraged actors from revealing who is behind the costume in order to preserve the fantasy peddled in its theme parks, but it has never before been a written policy, union officials said.\n\nDalton said performers may need to share which Disney character they’ve played in order to get acting jobs elsewhere, but they also respect the idea of keeping the ‘‘integrity’’ of the characters they play. That means not showing up in costume outside the theme parks or revealing to children that they’re a performer who plays Minnie Mouse.\n\n‘‘I believe in character integrity and not destroying the magic, but these are performers,’’ Dalton said. ‘‘A performer who plays Santa Claus and wants work, he goes out there and says, ‘I played Santa Claus.’ ’’",

        "instruction": "For nearly 20 years, Charles W. Bogar made a good living selling high-priced luxury goods in shops in Los Angeles and San Francisco, particularly to Japanese tourists. Along the way, he settled lawsuits from companies including Alfred Dunhill, Cartier, Louis Vuitton and Chanel that accused him of selling counterfeit goods.\n\nDespite the legal tussles, the profits rolled in. Mr. Bogar, who is 59, and his wife, Jo Ann, 51, lived in a suburban Los Angeles home that was once valued at $1.7 million. He drove a Maserati, she a Corvette.\n\nFor Mr. Bogar ran into another luxury goods company, Hunting World Inc., which was determined to put an end to what it contended were unauthorized sales. And while Mr. Bogar settled this complaint, too, without acknowledging wrongdoing, he paid a far steeper price than in the other settlements.\n\n\"Bob Lee has ruined me financially,\" Mr. Bogar said, referring to Robert M. Lee, the founder and owner of Hunting World, which is based in Sparks, Nev., and is known for its luggage, apparel, watches and jewelry. The company's catalogue lists a duffel bag at $1,400, a key case at $197 and a mother-of-pearl watch at $2,525.\n\nMr. Bogar now operates just one San Francisco store and is a retail consultant in Las Vegas. \"I've lost everything I had,\" he said. He decided to settle with Hunting World, he said, after his legal fees of $1 million exhausted his resources.\n\nMr. Bogar agreed to pay Hunting World $1.7 million at a rate of $30,000 a month. The Los Angeles home is up for sale, and the Bogars are in the midst of divorce proceedings.\n\nThe tale of Mr. Bogar and his settlement with Hunting World throws some light on how difficult luxury goods companies find it to stop the sales of unauthorized goods -- and, indeed, how hard it can be to determine just what is authentic.\n\nMr. Bogar and his lawyers, for example, say the Hunting World items he sold in his stores were identical to the real thing in every way except documentation -- a technicality, he told the Federal District Court in San Francisco, where the Hunting World case was heard.\n\nMr. Bogar obtained the merchandise, he said, through an Italian buying agent who approached Hunting World contractors in Florence and persuaded them to sell him the same goods that they were making for Hunting World. On a buying trip to Florence, Mr. Bogar visited a factory where Mr. Lee's picture was displayed, according to a lawyer for Mr. Bogar.\n\n\"My biggest mistake,\" Mr. Bogar said, \"was not going to trial because I believe we would have won, but I ran out of money.\"\n\nNot so, Hunting World and Mr. Lee said. In court papers, Mr. Lee said Mr. Bogar's merchandise was imported from Naples, from a factory where Hunting World did no business.\n\nBecause the case was settled with no admission of wrongdoing, it has not been determined which version is accurate.\n\nMr. Lee also told the court that Mr. Bogar approached Hunting World in 1988, trying to open an authorized boutique in San Francisco. Mr. Lee said in a letter included in the lawsuit that a shop like one Mr. Bogar already operated on Union Square would be expected to generate annual sales of up to $10 million, or an astonishing $4,347 a square foot.\n\nHunting World goods are sold in only 80 shops worldwide, and Mr. Lee declined to do business with Mr. Bogar, who then took a different approach.\n\nBut while such disputes are common in the world of luxury goods, few companies fight vigorously against what they see as counterfeiting. Most often, they attack the problem solely on the retail end, obtaining injunctions against further sales and seizing goods, say plaintiffs' lawyers and law enforcement officials. The results may put a retail target out of business but fail to root out wholesalers and manufacturers, who may be far more difficult to track.\n\nMr. Lee said he decided to go after Mr. Bogar more vigorously because of the previous accusations against him. \"While other well-known luxury brands have settled with counterfeiters for paltry and token amounts, we are aware that the offenders just come back,\" he said.\n\nHunting World has acted vigorously on other fronts as well. Mr. Lee said he was pursuing 100 counterfeiting claims against parties in several countries. In a raid by Italian customs police in May, two factories in Florence were seized, along with 452,000 items bearing copied trademark signatures from more than 30 fashion companies, including not just Hunting World but Gucci, Cartier and Ralph Lauren.\n\nHunting World says it has reduced knockoffs by 90 percent since 1992, when, it contends, sales of unauthorized goods stretched from Tuscany to Hong Kong and cost the company $100 million. It now spends $6 million annually protecting its brands.\n\nPart of the effort involves engraved bank note-style certificates enclosed with each piece of Hunting World merchandise. Imitators have had difficulty copying those certificates, Mr. Lee said.\n\nHunting World was founded in 1965 by Mr. Lee, who was then an outfitter for African safaris. To guard against Africa's extreme heat, humidity and dust, Mr. Lee helped develop a specialized fabric called Battue, which is coated with polyurethane and has a foam core and a snag-resistant inner liner. The fabric became a Hunting World trademark. The company's products are made by contractors in Italy.\n\nThe International Anticounterfeiting Coalition estimates that counterfeit products accounted for $200 billion in lost sales for United States companies in 1994, up from $60 billion seven years ago. United States Customs agents, however, seized only $38 million in counterfeit goods last year.\n\nNeil Van Horn, a special agent with the United States Customs Office in Portland, Ore., said few prosecutors had much enthusiasm for counterfeit-goods cases because their financial resources were stretched too thin to mount effective sting operations. Counterfeiters may demand a minimum order of $100,000 from a buyer.\n\nAnd it is not just the world's luxury goods makers who have to deal with knockoffs and counterfeits. Advances in photocopying, electronic digital scanning and desktop publishing in recent years have so improved the quality of reproductions that counterfeiters of all kinds of products can produce labels and documentation that look authentic. As a result, counterfeit goods are now infiltrating bona fide distribution networks and ending up on the shelves of established retailers.\n\nProblems with recent sales of bogus infant formula, ulcer drugs, shampoo and parts for airplanes, heart pumps and autos have prompted new calls for stricter laws against counterfeiting. Last month, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, proposed measures that would impose higher financial penalties on traffickers. The legislation is pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nPhotos: Hunting World, the luxury goods company, spends $6 million a year protecting the authenticity of its brands and is pursuing 100 counterfeiting claims in several countries.

        "instruction": "Environmental regulations designed to boost the amount of ethanol blended into the U.S. gasoline supply have inadvertently become a multibillion-dollar windfall for some of the world’s biggest oil companies.\n\nCompanies including Chevron Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and BP PLC could reap a total of more than $1 billion this year by selling the renewable fuel credits associated with the ethanol program, according to an analysis commissioned by CVR Energy , a refinery operator controlled by billionaire Carl Icahn, a vocal critic of the rules.\n\nFor other companies, especially smaller refiners, the rules have had the opposite effect, forcing them to spend hundreds of millions to buy credits to comply.\n\nSome large oil companies acknowledge they are reaping revenue from the regulations, but say their advantage stems from large investments they made to comply with it, and stress that not all of the money translates into profit.\n\n“Because a few other companies made different business decisions and are now living with the consequences is not a reason to suddenly change the rules,” said Geoff Morrell, a senior vice president for BP.\n\nThe regulations “are complex and cannot be simplified by only accounting for a company’s ability to blend ethanol,” Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said. A Shell spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Citgo, the U.S. arm of state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela SA, disputed it was profiting from the credits as the analysis claims, saying that it buys more than it sells annually to comply with its obligations.\n\nThe ethanol and biodiesel program, created during President George W. Bush’s administration, was aimed in part at reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. But those concerns have waned as a result of the abundant new U.S. oil and gas supplies unlocked by shale drilling. The rules require refiners to either blend ethanol with the gasoline they produce or buy credits.\n\nValero Energy Corp. disclosed when it reported third-quarter earnings Tuesday that it incurred $198 million in costs to meet biofuel blending rules during the period. It has said it will have to shell out as much as $850 million this year for the credits. PBF Energy Inc. has estimated costs will reach $300 million.\n\nThe top 10 U.S. refiners spent $1.1 billion on biofuel credits in the first half of this year, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Some refiners have warned they could be forced to conduct mass layoffs, or file for bankuptcy, because of the soaring costs of compliance.\n\n“The consumer is paying more and it’s ending up in the pockets of retailers, major oil companies or speculators,” said George Damiris, the chief executive of HollyFrontier Corp., a Midwestern refiner. “Over time, if this goes uncorrected, people will basically be put out of business.”\n\nThe price of the credits has skyrocketed this year, amid complaints from fuel suppliers that they are being forced by the Environmental Protection Agency to blend more ethanol than consumers or car makers are willing to accept.\n\nThe EPA has raised the required ethanol amount to 10.5% of total fuel as required by legislation. But auto makers argue that anything above 10% is potentially damaging to some engines, and consumers have been slow to embrace the more ethanol-heavy blends.\n\nAnother area of dispute is the step in the fuel supply chain at which the credits are created. It takes place at the point where ethanol and gasoline are blended. That favors companies that control vast networks of gasoline stations and thus reap more credits than the amount of oil they actually refine into fuel, while disadvantaging smaller refiners without as much of a retail presence.\n\nShell, which controls gasoline stations in the U.S. that sell about 1.6 million barrels of fuel a day, appears to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the program, according to the CVR analysis, conducted by refining consultant Baker & O’Brien Inc. The retail stations it controls exceed its U.S. refining capacity by about 1 million barrels a day, according to the study.\n\nThe cost of ethanol credits this year has ranged between $3 and $4 a barrel, according to refining analysts. That suggests Shell is structured to rake in as much as $1.5 billion annually from selling the credits.\n\nCitgo’s potential haul, according to the analysis, exceeds $900 million. BP and Chevron have the ability to sell between $200 million and $300 million in credits annually.\n\nValero, which spun off its retail stations in 2013, CVR and other refiners have suggested changing who is obligated to account for blending, making it retailers and wholesalers instead of refiners.\n\nBut the dispute over how to fix the program has created a rift in the oil industry, pitting some of the world’s biggest oil companies against smaller refiners. BP and the American Petroleum Institute have opposed the change, saying it could introduce significant uncertainty and do little to create incentives to blend ethanol. Exxon Mobil Corp. has argued the best solution would be repealing the entire program.\n\nEPA officials say they are reviewing the refiners’ proposal.\n\n—Alison Sider contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com",

        "instruction": "''JOHN JAMES AUDUBON AND HIS SONS'' at the Grey Art Gallery, 33 Washington Place, has a great deal that is fresh and unexpected to tell us about one of the great Americans whom we most take for granted.\n\nEveryone knows in a general way that Audubon was a combination of painter and man of science who has had no equal in this country when it comes to the representation of birds. His work turns up everywhere in reproduction, and for the huge and ever-growing company of American birders he doubles as founding father and president in perpetuity.\n\nBut it's not always easy to get a fix at first hand on what Audubon actually did. One of the best-looking books of recent times is ''Audubon's Birds of America,'' edited by Roger Tory Peterson and Virginia Marie Peterson, reproduced afresh from the Audubon Society's copy of the Audubon double elephant folio and published by the Abbeville Press. But that noble volume retails at $150 (a copy of the original folio sold at auction not long ago for $440,000, by the way).\n\nThe best way to see Audubon directly is still to go to the New-York Historical Society, where we can scrutinize his works in quantity any time we like. But even there we don't exactly stand in an eager throng. Most people settle for the shadow of a shadow where Audubon is concerned. The freshness, the sense of drama, the scientific precision and the wit come to them screened and muted.\n\nNor do most enthusiasts for Audubon know his career in detail. Audubon himself was a champion obfuscater, who in talking or writing of his earlier career, liked nothing better than to conceal and deceive. (When later it was their turn to guard the flame, his widow and his granddaughter proved to be every bit as cunning as he.) When he died in 1851 at the age of 65, there seemed no reason to question the verdict of Harper's magazine: ''His was a happy life. He had found his vocation, and pursued it for long years, earnestly, faithfully and triumphantly.''\n\nBut it is the lesson of ''John James Audubon & His Sons'' that Audubon did not always by any means have a happy life and that much of his career was anything but triumphant. Organized and catalogued by Gary A. Reynolds, this is, in effect, an exhibition of ''the other Audubon.'' Born in Haiti in 1785, Audubon was the illegitimate son of a French sea captain and a French servant girl, who died when he was less than a year old. Reared in France, he did not became a naturalized United States citizen until 1812.\n\nWhether as a French naval cadet, as the overseer of his father's land holdings in Pennsylvania or as a storekeeper in Louisville, Ky., Audubon was a mess. Nothing went right for him. As an aspirant artist, he talked big, but showed only minimal talent. (It is very difficult to believe him when he claims to have studied under Jacques-Louis David in Paris.) For 20 years he had no place of his own to call home.\n\nIn 1819 his store went bankrupt. Rats ate a portfolio of drawings of ''nearly a thousand inhabitants of the air'' that he had sent to his family for safekeeping. American men of science snubbed him. He found the Philadelphians ''unwilling to pay for art, though they affected to patronize it.'' Only in England and Scotland, where he arrived in 1826, did he at last find a welcome. Meanwhile, he did what he could, when and how he could, to keep his career in being.\n\nAll this is made clear both in the Grey Gallery exhibition and in Mr. Reynolds's catalogue. Many of the paintings and drawings are journeyman work, and there's no point in pretending that Audubon excelled either as a painter in oils or as a portrait draftsman. But the very ineptitude of some of these things is touching, and when we get the sharpness, the virtuosity and the intellectual distinction of Audubon at his best, we prize them all the more. The show can be seen through June 5. Don't miss, by the way, the mischievous high spirits and the sense of parody with which Jane Kaplowitz has embellished the windows of the gallery on the Washington Square side.\n\nOther shows of interest: ''Art of the Bauhaus'' (Helen Serger-La Boetie, 9 East 82d Street): Contrary to what is now often supposed, the Bauhaus was a great deal of fun. So far from wishing to impose a willed uniformity upon the world of the future, it aimed to turn our daily environment into one huge continuous work of art. Imaginations were to be stretched. Everyday life was to be consistently more comfortable, more stimulating and more inventive. The very name of ''Utopia'' was to be a thing of beauty.\n\nThe La Boetie exhibition includes some very fine works of art - notably Paul Klee's ''The Wild Man,'' in which a tradition already many centuries old is made new - but it is pre-eminently a brisk sampling of the Bauhaus as it affected the applied arts. Furniture, graphics, advertising, household objects, stage design, typography and the art of the book -all are touched upon. Even the postcard has its moment of glory. For its size, this is a remarkable show, and it can be seen through June 30.\n\nAnne Dunn (Fischbach Gallery, 29 West 57th Street): Midway between painting and drawing, Anne Dunn's new work is marked above all by what might be called a heroic diffidence. The individual marks - all made with colored inks - are needly, precise and considered. But in the landscapes -most of them done in New Brunswick - this obsessional detail is mated with a command of long tunnel-like spaces, sheets of water not long reclaimed from the winter ice, and enormous white skies.\n\nThere is, in fact, a great deal of white on those very large sheets of paper - chalk white, bone white, plaster white, bandage white. The high clear reds and greens and yellows bite like very young crabs, meanwhile. So the general effect is of an astringency abated here and there by an eccentric choice of subject matter and a feeling for random disorder. The alternation of deep space and dead end from one painting to another keeps us guessing, too. There is plenty to look at, and to think about, in these paintings. (Through May 26.)\n\nSherman Drexler (Max Hutchinson Gallery, 138 Greene Street): Sherman Drexler's new paintings - mostly quite small - have been installed in an apparently haphazard way, as if on an outsize bulletin board. As on other occasions, their subject is a well-covered and manifestly athletic female nude who gazes around her as if wondering whom to throw out of the window next.\n\nBut it's all in play, with no harm intended. The touch of the brush is both fat and gentle, the matching of flesh color with background color shows a great deal of resource, and the individual figure has a lollopy, informal quality that comes as a joy and a relief at a time when painting the human figure so often looks like a penance. (Through May 29.)\n\nIllustrations: photo of a portrait of Mrs. Sarah Best",

        "instruction": "On Tuesday a consortium of technology companies, including IBM , will launch a new initiative designed to help shield the open-source software community from threats posed by companies or individuals holding dubious software patents and seeking payment for alleged infringements by open-source software products.\n\nThe most novel feature of the new program, to be known as Linux Defenders, will be its call to independent open-source software developers all over the world to start submitting their new software inventions to Linux Defenders (Web site due to be operational Tuesday) so that the group’s attorneys and engineers can, for no charge, help shape, structure, and document the invention in the form of a “defensive publication.”\n\nLinux Defenders will then also see to it that the publication, duly attributing authorship of the invention to the developer who submitted it, is filed on the IP.com Web site, a database used by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and other patent examiners throughout the world when they are trying to determine whether a proposed patent is truly novel, as any patentable invention is supposed to be.\n\nIn effect, the defensive-publications initiative mounts a preemptive attack upon those who would try to patent purported software inventions that are not truly novel — i.e., innovations that are already known and in use, though no one may have ever previously bothered to document them, let alone obtain a patent on them, a process usually requiring the hiring of attorneys as well as payment of significant filing fees.\n\n“The idea is to create a defensive patent shield or no-fly zone around Linux,” says Keith Bergelt, the chief executive officer of Open Invention Network, the consortium launching the site. The core members of that group, formed in 2005, are IBM, NEC, Novell , Philips, Red Hat RHT and Sony.\n\nOIN’s Linux Defender program is being co-sponsored by two of the most prominent guardians of the free- and open-source software community, the Linux Foundation in San Francisco and the Software Freedom Law Center in New York. In addition, the site is being hosted and “co-developed” by New York Law School, which has, since June 2007, been sponsoring, in coordination with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, its own well-received, complementary project, known as the Peer to Patent Community Patent Review site. That site solicits assistance from the open-source community to produce evidence that an invention for which a patent is currently being sought was actually already known or in use prior to the patent applicant’s filing.\n\nSo-called free- and open-source software is software that, by its licensing terms, confers certain “freedoms” upon users that are usually forbidden by conventional proprietary software companies, like Microsoft. These freedoms include the right to see the software’s source code, alter it, copy it, and redistribute it. The best known open-source product is Linux, or GNU/Linux, a complete open-source operating system that has become quite popular among Fortune 500 corporations for use on their data-center servers. Patents threaten the whole free-and-open-source eco-system, however, in that none of the key open-source freedoms can be practiced if an outsider can establish that a given piece of software infringes a valid patent he holds.\n\nThe Linux Defenders program is largely the brainchild of Bergelt, who took over as Open Invention Network’s CEO this past February. The program also reflects a new, more proactive role Bergelt envisions for OIN than the group has played in the past.\n\nUntil now, OIN’s purpose has been one-dimensional: to acquire a defensive portfolio of strategically crucial patents, which OIN makes available, royalty free, to any company that reciprocally agrees not to assert any of its own patents against the Linux community. (About 50 companies have already entered into such formal agreements with OIN, of which the best known are probably Google and Oracle .) The implicit threat is that if any outsider — a Microsoft, say, which declared publicly in May 2007 that open-source software then violated 235 of its patents — were to ever bring a patent suit against a player in the Linux community, that outsider would, in turn, risk countersuit by OIN or its member companies asserting infringement of their own patents by the outsider.\n\nWhile this IP-acquisition program remains a central one for OIN, Bergelt says, OIN will also now seek to “think more creatively” about other ways to protect and foster Linux’s development by means of “relationship-building” and “information-sharing,” including efforts to explain the importance of open-source and open-platform approaches to the media, patent officials, and competition authorities, among others.\n\nBefitting someone who plans to tackle this ambitious range of goals, Bergelt has a background that is more diverse than that of his intellectual-property lawyer predecessor, Jerry Rosenthal, who, prior to heading OIN, had served as IBM’s IP-licensing chief. Though Bergelt is also an IP lawyer, he is, in addition, an entrepreneur and diplomat. Immediately prior to joining OIN, Bergelt was the president and CEO of the intellectual-property focused hedge fund Paradox Capital. Before that, he was a senior advisor to private-equity fund Texas Pacific Group (now TPG); headed the strategic intellectual asset management unit at Motorola; and co-founded the strategic intellectual asset management unit within the electronics and telecommunications group at SRI Consulting in Menlo Park. Earlier still in his career, he spent 12 years as a U.S. foreign service officer, including a posting to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, where he negotiated IP rights agreements with certain Asian countries, including China.\n\nThe Linux Defenders program will actually have three components. The first will be a peer-to-patent component that, like New York Law School’s existing program, will reach out to the open-source community in search of evidence of “prior art” — proof of preexisting knowledge or use of certain inventions — that can be used to challenge applications for patents that have been filed but not yet granted. The goal here is to persuade patent examiners not to grant the patent being sought because the invention is not truly novel.\n\nThe second component will be a natural extension of the first, to be known as “Post-Grant Peer to Patent,” which will enlist similar community assistance in the search for prior art relevant to patents that have already actually issued. In this case, the goal would be — assuming such prior art is found — to initiate an administrative reexamination proceeding before the U.S. PTO to get the patent invalidated. (There have been some earlier post-grant, peer-to-patent efforts — sometimes referred to as peer-to-issue programs — by both nonprofits and private companies, but none with the commitment, and on the scale, that OIN envisions, Bergelt says.)\n\nThe third component is the defensive-publications initiative. The phenomenon of defensive publication is also not new, Bergelt acknowledges, although it has primarily been used in the past by private companies protecting proprietary business models. Since at least the 1970s, he says, when the filing of an important patent by one company would often spur rivals to respond by seeking inter-related patents designed to restrict the usefulness of the first company’s filing, proprietary companies began using defensive publication to beef up and buffer their core patents.\n\n“They’d file one patent,” Bergelt explains, “and then the next day they’d file thirty defensive publications that would protect all of the extensions of it they could think of, so the core patent was fenced off by layers of barbed wire, if you will. . . . What I’ve done is turn that idea on its head a little bit.” (Defensive publications are cheaper and easier to prepare than full-fledged patent-applications.)\n\nAlthough some factions of the free- and open-source community are ideologically opposed to the whole notion of software patents — most notably and passionately Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation (which is a client of Linux-Defenders co-sponsor Software Freedom Law Center, which, in turn, supports the End Software Patents organization) — neither Bergelt nor OIN fall into that camp.\n\n“We’re not anti-patent by any stretch of the imagination,” says Bergelt. “More patents is fine with me, as long as they’re high quality. Quality is the drum we beat.”\n\nIn fact, Bergelt says, if a developer wants to get an actual patent on his invention, and then put defensive publications around it, Linux Defenders will help him do so — so long as the developer will ultimately be contributing the patent to the Linux community.",

Comparing herself to the mass-market media queen, she added, “would make me sound like a megalomaniac.”\n\nEven so, she admitted that her motivation to sell is, in part, to broaden her reach way beyond politics, where HuffPo began. Though the business started in 2005 as a political blog site, “only 15% of the content today is political,” Huffington, 60, noted. She sees AOL’s platforms as ideal places to propagate all sorts of non-political content–and specifically, to target women on various fronts. “One of my passions is women and health and how do we lead our lives better?” Huffington told me.\n\nWhen I asked her what she will bring to the AOL properties, she replied, “The headline is reader engagement.” She is proud of the fact that HuffPo, through its generation of multitudinous reader comments and its partnerships with Facebook and Twitter, significantly beats AOL on the social networking front. Her mission, in part, will be to make AOL’s news and other content “fully social.”\n\nMeanwhile, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong covets greater access to women and influentials (and by recruiting Arianna to his team, he captures both). Armstrong has talked for a while about an “80-80-80 focus.” His theory is that 80% of domestic consumer spending is done by women, that 80% of it is done locally, and that 80% of “considered purchases” are driven by influencers.\n\nAs for the influential and irrepressible Huffington, she is prepping for her new, busier life by moving to New York, while keeping her home in Los Angeles. “I’m canceling speeches and doubling down,” she said.\n\nLast night, following the media swirl around the AOL-HuffPo announcement, Huffington flew from the East Coast to Los Angeles with Armstrong. Instead of sleeping, they talked and waged a one-on-one battle to whittle down to the fewest unread emails. “He was about to win, so I kept forwarding him emails,” Huffington confessed. She began the flight with 2,300 unread emails and got down to 750. That wasn’t good enough. Armstrong won the competition.",

        "instruction": "LONDON, June 15— David Rolland Spedding, who rose to head the Secret Intelligence Service, or M.I.6 -- a position immortalized by the author Ian Fleming as the espionage supremo known only as M -- died on Wednesday. He was 58.\n\nHe died of lung cancer, the agency announced.\n\nSir David's career as agent and spymaster saw the business of spying emerge from the cold war to face other threats from terrorism, organized crime and rogue states.\n\nIn some ways, he was steeped in British espionage traditions. He was recruited as a spy at 24, while still a postgraduate history student at Oxford University. And while he was only the second head of M.I.6 to be publicly identified by name, he maintained some cover until his death: photographs of him in Wednesday's British newspapers were the first to be published.\n\nUnlike many of his predecessors, cold warriors who learned their craft spying on the Soviet Union, Sir David was an Arabist who spent much of his working life in the Middle East before his appointment in 1994 as C, as Britain's top spymaster is traditionally known. In another tradition, it is said that C is the only person permitted to write secret memos in green ink.\n\nAnd if there was a fictional precedent for Sir David, it was to be found not so much in M, who sent James Bond off on his missions, but rather perhaps in the work of John le Carré, the pseudonym of David Cornwell, whose 1986 novel, ''A Perfect Spy,'' depicted the difficult relationship between a spy and his father.\n\nThe Times of London said in its obituary that Sir David's school days were spent in the shadow of his father, who had attended the same private school in Dorset, rising to prominence as a sportsman and a leader. Sir David preferred clandestine meetings with kindred spirits among classmates more interested in talk, wine and tobacco than in rugby.\n\nThose gatherings, Sir David suggested in one of very few published interviews, gave him his first experience of a covert cell operating behind the lines set by school regulations. While his father was a British Army colonel, Sir David joined an annual antinuclear protest march in 1959, angering both his father and his school.\n\nDavid Rolland Spedding was born on March 7, 1943, and had a traditional upper-middle-class upbringing at the Sherborne private school and Hertford College, Oxford, where he studied medieval history. He was formally recruited into M.I.6 in 1967 and worked under diplomatic cover in Beirut after learning Arabic at the British Foreign Office language training school in Lebanon.\n\nWhile he also served as a spy in Chile from 1972 to 1974, at the time Salvador Allende's government was being destabilized, he worked mainly in the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi and Jordan, where he spied on Iraq's covert weapons supplies.\n\nIn 1984, according to associates, he played a behind-the-scenes role, the details of which remain classified, in thwarting a bomb attack planned by Abu Nidal on Queen Elizabeth II during a royal visit to Amman, Jordan. With characteristic modesty, he played down his part in the episode, which ended when Jordanian agents arrested the would-be bombers.\n\nBy the time Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, Sir David was in charge of all of Britain's Middle East intelligence activities, including covert operations during the Persian Gulf war.\n\nBut it was on the home front that he faced the most controversy over issues like M.I.6's move to new, high-profile headquarters on the banks of the Thames, accusations that M.I.6 had plotted to assassinate Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and the secret service's tactics in spying on Mr. Hussein's weapons programs. Sir David retired from the service in 1999.\n\nSir David is survived by his wife, Gillian, and two sons.\n\nPhoto: Sir David Rolland Spedding",

On Monday morning, Masters was scrambling to reboot Toddland's website and to manufacture more of the now-iconic onesies after \"social media blew up\" with interest from would-be buyers.\n\n\"It's exciting. I had more than 200 messages this morning telling me we should restock, and I was like, 'No (expletive)!'\" he said.\n\nRetailers say the adult onesie has replaced the Snuggie as the zeitgeist's ironic loungewear of choice. That might be because owners can demonstrate their devotion to comfortable loafing while maintaining a \"youthful\" image, according to Andrew DeBell, who coincidentally on Monday was launching a Kickstarter campaign for a one-piece business called Funsies Onesies Clothing.\n\n\"Onesies are incredibly comfortable,\" DeBell said. \"You can wear them to do whatever you want.\"\n\nThe adult onesie, though, is not new. Winston Churchill was an early adopter, pioneering a tailored, pinstriped one-piece \"siren suit\" cut to accommodate his ample heft during World War II. The 1970s saw a regrettable trend for aviation-inspired one-piece flight suits for men who had no business at the controls of a jet.\n\nA workwear trend in menswear has in recent years seen an uptick in the number of firms offering so-called union suits, whose seamless design can help seal out drafts during the harsh Midwestern winter. And the look got a boost when athletes donned onesies off-piste at the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014.\n\nToday's typical onesie wearer has more of a sense of fun, according to Masters, who said men in California will go bar-hopping \"with funny underpants on underneath and the butt flap open.\"\n\n\"Girls wear them unbuttoned nearly all the way down,\" he added.\n\nTerri Hunsinger of webundies.com, which has been selling adult onesies since 1999, said they are typically hot at Halloween, when they can double as both costume and insulation, and at Christmas. A Batman model is her best-seller, but a \"Weedman\" onesie is most popular in Colorado, she said.\n\nStill, despite all the publicity the Cubs outfits got Sunday night, there was no noticeable uptick in sales of Cubs onesies Monday morning, she said.\n\nNor were Cubs fans, hoping to emulate their heroes, lining up around the block at Wrigleyville Sports next to Wrigley Field when it opened Monday.\n\nWrigleyville Sports doesn't sell adult onesies, at least not yet, said store worker David Colon. \"But it's still early in the day.\"",

        "instruction": "Sunday, September 10th 2000, 2:14AM\n\nPeter Shankman had a problem. His beloved 7-year-old Macintosh computer, which had seen him through innumerable college term papers, just wasn't usable anymore. Too weak to surf the Web, guided by software that was obsolete, this old friend was ready for retirement.\n\nHe thought of donating it to a school or a nonprofit group, but the old Mac's limitations would be even more frustrating to a student or researcher in today's networked world.\n\nNeither could he bring himself to throw it away; he was too attached to the machine and it seemed disrespectful to toss it into a landfill. Plus, discarded computers are an environmental threat.\n\n\"It's a computer,\" said Shankman, president of the public-relations firm Geek Factory. \"You don't throw it away. It's like those Chinese food containers my mother has. There's always a use for them.\"\n\nIndeed, he found one: He turned it into a server for uploaded MP3 songs. Not powerful enough to play the digital music files directly and without a hard drive large enough to store them, his old Macintosh had a new lease on life directing music fans to his collection located on another computer on his home network.\n\nShankman's solution is one of the more inventive uses for old but not totally useless computers. Even if it's a stand for your fax machine in your parent's basement, the fate of another of Shankman's antediluvian computers, there's usually someone who can take them off your hands.\n\nSome of the uses are esthetic: Mountains of old gear decorate the bathrooms at East Village Internet cafe alt.coffee. Original Macintosh computers from 1984 also make excellent fishtanks called Maquariums.\n\nOther solutions are more practical. A firm in Tennessee, Diversified Environmental Services Inc., specializes in making landscaping bricks out of ground-up monitor screens and concrete. Plans to make garden benches, statues and fountains out of old computers are in the works.\n\nHow to dispose of or recycle old computers has become a critical issue for the industry. The number of outdated computers is set to skyrocket, to 315 million by 2004, and this could be hazardous to the nation's environment.\n\n\"It's a growing problem right now,\" said Jeremiah Baumann, environmental advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington. \"Computers are filled with all sorts of toxic chemicals, everything from huge amounts of lead in the monitors to mercury and cadmium in other parts of the computers themselves.\"\n\nThe Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, an environmental group that monitors the ecological health of areas around Silicon Valley, estimates that the millions of soon-to-be-obsolete computers contain 1.2 billion pounds of lead, 2 million pounds of cadmium, 400,000 pounds of mercury and 1.2 million pounds of hexavalent chromium, which can cause lung cancer.\n\nAnd then there's the matter of the computer housing, almost universally plastic, which takes millions of years to break down. Dumping all these computers in the nation's landfills would quickly fill them up with plastic housings alone.\n\nMost old computers can have some value either to a nonprofit or as a link in a network. But don't assume that public schools are lusting after your castoffs.\n\n\"Unless it's Ethernet-ready and it has a processor speed that can keep up, it's basically useless,\" said Andrew Rasiej, founder of Mouse (Making Opportunities for Upgrading Schools & Educations). \"Otherwise, the schools are always using second-rate equipment and will keep falling further and further behind.\"\n\nRasiej founded Mouse to help bring the Net to New York's public schools, a difficult job made even more difficult, he said, by donated computers that can't easily network with machines already installed or don't have the processor power to handle today's Internet applications.\n\n\"To get a 486 [processor] to run Netscape ... well, it's a chore,\" he said. \"When Mouse first got started, we quickly discovered that the amount of time it takes to take an old machine and figure out what is still working ... is not worth the work it takes.\"\n\nAs you might expect, Mouse does not take donated equipment unless it's almost new, out of the box. Mouse gets most of its equipment through sponsorships by computer manufacturers.\n\nRasiej suggested donating used computers to neighborhood nonprofits or community organizations that have the time and energy to upgrade them and fit them to their needs.\n\nOne of them is Computers for Youth, founded by Elisabeth Stock. She takes old computers and rejuvenates them for families in poor neighborhoods.\n\nBut even CFY has to place some limits on what it will accept, and donations of relatively new computers are preferred.\n\n\"We will take them if they're Pentiums and really souped up,\" she said. \"We're trying to have our computers be as similar as possible. We're doing the tech support for the computers, so it's to our benefit that they're all of one model.\"\n\nOther nonprofits include Non-Profit Computing, run by John Germain, and the Independent Media Center, which covered the protests surrounding the United Nations Globalization Summit last week. Bonnie Scott, a system administrator at Blue Sky Studios in White Plains, donated an old 486 computer and some audio-visual equipment so that they could produce their reports and get them onto the Web.\n\nOthers give their hand-me-downs to friends and relatives. Monique Elwell, president and CEO of Amisto.com, an adventure travel Web site, said that for years she had been giving her old systems to her \"technically challenged\" friends and \"guilting\" them into getting E-mail so she could communicate with them rapidly.\n\n\"Recently, my CD-ROM and modem went on the fritz but the rest of my personal computer worked fine,\" she said. \"The expense and hassle of getting a new CD-ROM and modem was not worth [it], so I gave it to my mother's neighbor, whose hobby is computers and their parts.\"\n\nFor the more technically adept, no computer is ever unusable, as Shankman and others have shown.\n\nChristopher Rywalt, a Web programmer in Wood-Ridge, N.J., uses his old computers to protect his home network by using them as firewalls - gateways that reduce the threat from computer criminals or viruses.\n\n\"I also know people who use their outdated PCs as home controllers, connecting them to light switches, the phone and so on,\" he said. \"I've considered using a Pentium I've got lying around as a high-tech call-screener so I can avoid calls from telemarketers.\"\n\nHis ultimate dream, though, doesn't include computer security or banished telemarketers or even digital aquariums.\n\n\"I want to build my own pinball machine and control it with a leftover PC,\" he said.\n\nContact Chris Allbritton at callbritton@edit.nydailynews.com.",

Odets had a fondness for stylized patter on the order of: “Say the word — I’ll tango on a dime. Don’t gimme ice when your heart’s on fire!’’ But Bensussen maintains her focus on the timeless dilemmas at the play’s heart, which makes the period-piece cobwebs less noticeable as the production gathers momentum.\n\nFor all its noisy showdowns — the play could just as easily be titled “Awake and Shout!’’ — Bensussen lets its silences speak, too. As in her Huntington productions of Annie Baker’s “Circle Mirror Transformation’’ and Kirsten Greenidge’s “The Luck of the Irish,’’ the director makes sure that we fully see and hear the characters straining after individual identity within a complex group.\n\nOdets’s skill at weaving together personal and political conflicts remains impressive, and there’s an inherent value to discovering how the world looked to a lower-middle-class Jewish family in a certain time (the Huntington production is set in 1935-36) and place (the Bronx). This is especially the case when there are parallels to our own time, with the country still emerging, groggily, from the trauma of the Great Recession. One big difference between now and then: “Awake and Sing!’’ is animated by a belief in collective action that has been largely absent — except for the Occupy movement — from the nation’s response to the injustices highlighted by the recession.\n\nAs a man of the left whose work was fueled by a spirit of social protest, Odets had a none-too-subtle message to impart, principally embodied here by Jacob, the labor-championing, Marx-quoting grandfather, who is played with seething intensity by Will LeBow. Early in the play, Jacob declares: “If this life leads to a revolution, it’s a good life. Otherwise it’s for nothing.’’ He tends to speak in absolutist terms, but what makes LeBow’s performance so compelling is that it’s clear that for all Jacob’s fervent denunciations of capitalists, he reserves his most damning verdict for himself, for not doing more to bring about the change he has long espoused.\n\nJacob’s political pronouncements greatly exasperate Bessie, his middle-aged daughter. Lori Wilner’s portrayal of Bessie skillfully conveys the sense of a woman who is always playing offense and defense at the same time. Bessie’s own view of life has been circumscribed by circumstance. Jobs are scarce, money is tight, and her husband, Myron (David Wohl), is an ineffectual figure who drifts through his days in a cloud of befuddlement. Scruples matter less to Bessie than survival. She is fiercely and unapologetically pragmatic, even ruthless, in exerting her will when it comes to her children, Hennie (Annie Purcell) and Ralph (Michael Goldsmith), both of whom are in their 20s and still living at home.\n\nWhen Bessie almost literally sniffs out a secret Hennie has been hiding, the mother instantly comes up with a solution that involves a recent immigrant, Sam (Nael Nacer). This is not a happy development for a boarder in the Bergers’ home who is in love with Hennie: Moe Axelrod, who lost a leg in World War I and is played by Eric T. Miller with a raffish, rough-edged charm. Moe always seems to be around, shrewdly appraising the family’s machinations and offering mordant observations.\n\nRounding out the contentious family portrait is Uncle Morty (Stephen Schnetzer), Jacob’s son and Bessie’s brother, a hard-charging businessman who has nothing but amused contempt for his father’s political beliefs. But Jacob and his grandson Ralph enjoy a special closeness (“Go out and fight so life shouldn’t be printed on dollar bills,’’ the old man exhorts him) that will eventually, in one of the key episodes in “Awake and Sing!,’’ lead to drastic action by one of them.\n\nExceptional scenic design is one of the Huntington’s hallmarks, and James Noone’s set for “Awake and Sing!’’ is no exception. The Bergers’ fastidious home is a monument to Bessie’s tireless efforts and her skill at image management, while behind and above their dining room rise two levels of apartment doors and windows. It suggests both the hemmed-in environment they live in and maybe, just maybe, the possibility of escape.\n\n• Family ties add layers to Huntington’s ‘Awake and Sing’",

        "instruction": "ONE is reminded of Candide's resolve to cultivate his own garden. The Princeton-based Hillier Group, architects, planners and interior designers, is ranked among the largest concerns of its type in the United States. Its most ambitious current undertaking is the planning and design of a $700 million city on Seddon Island in the heart of Tampa, Fla., a city that will include housing for 14,000 and a mile and a half of waterfront facilities.\n\nYet, J.Robert Hillier, who founded the company 15 years ago, seems as pleased with its work on two neighboring condominium projects practically in the group's own backyard.\n\nFor example, Design Interface, a subsidiary of the Hillier Group, developed Markham Square. Its original plan called for the demolition of a vintage 1888 house on the site and the construction of 12 new town houses.\n\nAs it turned out, the proposal was not presented to the Princeton Borough Zoning Board when scheduled, since the board spent the lion's share of that particular meeting considering another developer's plan to convert still another large old house into a multi-family dwelling.\n\n''We reconsidered the historical aspects of the 1888 house,'' Mr. Hillier said, ''and the plan was redesigned in one month.'' The revised plan called for the construction of 10 town houses, plus the conversion of the old house into two condominiums. The house had to be moved 26 feet (at a cost of $1,000 a foot) to accommodate the new plan, a task that was accomplished in two and a half weeks by C.Van Howling and Sons of Wallington.\n\nAlthough moving a house that weighs 275 tons, including all of the mover's needed steel framework, is not simple, Donald Christie, president of C.Van Howling, referred to it as a ''nice, short move with no unusual problems. It was difficult in the sense that it was an old house and had been moved before, but no special precautions had to be made that we wouldn't have made ordinarily.''\n\nMarkham Square opened for occupancy last April. The town houses were priced at $216,000, and the two condiminiums in the restored house, one of which is still unsold, were priced at $245,000.\n\nAccording to Mr. Hillier, the town houses appeal to young people who may not have amassed a lot of money for down payments, but whose monthly cash flow is nonetheless sub-stantial.\n\nWith this project, Mr. Hillier has embarked on what he perceives to be an inevitable march toward ''the developer as joint venturer.'' He has offered a version of a ''shared appreciation mortgage,'' in which he is providing financing at 8.45 percent in return for the right to claim one-third of the town house's appreciation in 10 years or upon its sale.\n\nFive of the town houses have been sold this way. If the town houses appreciate, it would be partly the result of improving a building across the street from them on Markham Road. Originally designed as an office building, the three-story concrete structure, now known as One Markham, had stood partly finished, boarded up and graffiti ridden for about 10 years.\n\n''We had always been concerned about the unfinished building,'' Mr. Hillier recalled, ''and one day our business manager got a call from the owner's attorney asking if we knew of anyone who would be interested in buying a building coming up for a sheriff's sale.''\n\nAnd so Mr. Hillier and his wife, Susan, bought the building for $415,000 and the Hillier Group set about planning what to do with it. ''People in the borough were nervous about it,'' said Paul Douglas of Stewardson-Dougherty Real Estate Associates, a Princeton brokerage concern, and the marketing manager for One Markham.\n\n''For 10 or 11 years, it was the center of controversy. It was an eyesore, and people were beginning to think that it would be a blight on the neighborhood forever. Personally, I felt that it would be more suitable as a residence than as an office building, and it was a pleasant surprise to see what the Hilliers planned to do.''\n\nWith the blessings of borough regulatory agencies, the building was converted into a condominium with 17 two-bedroom units, each of about 1,300 square feet. Five of the apartments on the first floor have private gardens, and prices range from $159,000 to $185,000.\n\n''It's a very nice apartment building,'' Mr. Douglas said. ''There is nothing else like it here; you can drive into a garage that's electronically controlled and take an elevator to your floor.''\n\nTen of the units have been sold, primarily to older couples whose children no longer live with them and who no longer need large homes. Although the Hilliers have arranged for mortgage financing for their buyers, few are applying for loans.\n\n''These buyers are traders,'' Mr. Douglas said. ''They're selling something to buy something. One or two are applying for mortgages just in case they haven't sold their houses before they close here.''\n\nInitial occupancy of the building is scheduled this summer. One of the important things he has learned, Mr. Hillier said, is that people still have an inherent desire for quality and are willing to pay for it. Moreover, they want smaller housing in downtown areas, as attested to by the fact that some 300 people came to One Markham's open house.\n\nMrs. Hillier involvement in the marketing and financial facets of One Markham has drawn praise from Mr. Douglas. ''She's really candid,'' he explained. ''People aren't used to hearing something like, 'Look here, we've budgeted so-and-so many dollars for landscaping,' and such. It doesn't hurt. It makes believers out of people.''\n\nWhy did Mr. and Mrs. Hillier and their associates choose all the financial risk, legal wrangling, long hours of work and myriad details involved in both projects?\n\n''We're not making any money to speak of, but it's fun,'' Mr. Hillier said, ''and there is definitely a need for housing here.'' George E. Olexa, who wears a number of hats, including that of Borough Engineer, said that Princeton was, indeed, pleased with the improvements the Hilliers had wrought.\n\n''The borough encourages housing, and it enjoys ratables,'' he said.

        "instruction": "Armed with a family recipe and a flair for marketing, C. James ‘‘Jim’’ Koch popularized craft beer in the United States and turned Boston Beer Co. into the second-largest American-owned brewery. It also made him a billionaire.\n\nCraft beer such as Sam Adams has been a bright spot in an otherwise stale US beer market. Total American beer sales fell 2 percent in the first half of 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while the craft brew segment grew 15 percent. Boston Beer’s sales increased more than 17 percent during the period.\n\n‘‘What he has done is amazing,’’ said David Geary, president of D.L. Geary Brewing, a craft brewer in Portland, Maine, he cofounded in 1983. ‘‘He’s very focused, a brilliant marketer, and he sort of taught us all how to sell beer.’’\n\nThrough a combination of in-person proselytizing and folksy TV ads, Koch created widespread awareness in the 1980s and 1990s that there was more to beer than what the major US brewers and European imports were offering.\n\nConsumers have flocked to Boston Beer’s 70-plus offerings, including its most popular seller, Boston Lager, and to small-batch specialty brews, such as Norse Legend, a Finnish-style sahti that Vikings drank. The demand has sent Boston Beer shares up tenfold since mid-2009, propelling Koch’s net worth above $1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He has never appeared on an international wealth ranking.\n\n‘‘Having watched my stock price go up and down and up, it seems almost whimsical,’’ Koch, 64, said. ‘‘I remind people getting rich is life’s great booby prize. Any normal person would much rather be happy than rich.’’\n\nSelling craft beer has made Koch both. Last week, Koch planned to travel to Los Angeles and Maine, where he would go bar-to-bar trying to persuade beverage managers to carry Sam Adams, something he has done since he started brewing beer in his Newton kitchen in 1984.\n\n‘‘Because this was something started out of passion, I’ve been able to sustain 30 years of growing the business with all the ups and downs,’’ Koch said.\n\nCraft beer continues to require such hands-on sales calls. The segment occupies a niche in the US beer market, with about 6.5 percent market share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Together, Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev, which sells more than 200 brands, including Budweiser and Beck’s, and MillerCoors, a 70-brand joint venture of London-based SABMiller and Denver-based Miller Coors Brewing Co., control about 80 percent of the US beer market.\n\nBoston Beer has 1.3 percent of the US market, just behind DG Yuengling & Son Inc., the largest US-owned brewing company, with a 1.5 percent share. Its owner — and Koch’s friend — Richard L. ‘‘Dick’’ Yuengling, has a fortune valued at more than $2.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg index.\n\n‘‘The Street generally likes underdogs like Boston Beer and the way that they are growing share by producing a better product,’’ said Kenneth Shea, a beverage industry analyst with Bloomberg Industries in Princeton, N.J. ‘‘The mass-produced industrial brands tend to be bland and undifferentiated.’’\n\nTo avoid a taste too similar to rival beers, Koch samples every batch of beer his company produces and leads purchasing trips to Germany each year to buy hops, according to the company.\n\nKoch is the sixth-generation oldest son in a row to be a brewer. Born in 1949, Koch grew up in Cincinnati, where his father was a brewmaster. The domestic beer business had been decimated by Prohibition, a period from 1920 to 1933 when the United States outlawed the production and sale of alcoholic beverages. Grain rationing in World War II then steered public tastes away from richer-flavored small batch beers to lighter-styled brands such as Budweiser and Coors.\n\nThe emergence of national television advertising and ease of transport allowed the major beer makers to dominate the market. Seeing no chance to be a brewmaster, Koch decided to pursue a different career.\n\nAfter attending Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate school, Koch went to work for Boston Consulting Group in 1979, advising pulp and steel mills on manufacturing processes. When he decided he wanted to pursue his passion for beer, there were about a dozen craft brewers in the country, Koch said.\n\n‘‘Everyone thought I was crazy, like I was leaving consulting to go make mud pies,’’ he said. His original business plan was to be selling $1 million worth of beer in five years, have eight employees, and pay himself a salary of $60,000.\n\nWhen his father realized Koch was serious about starting a brewery, they went into the attic and dug out the recipe developed in the 1860s by his great-great grandfather Louis Koch. That became the basis for Boston Lager. Within a year, his marketing scored two boosts: taking the brand name from Samuel Adams, a Revolutionary War Patriot he found had a brewing connection, and getting the beer named the country’s best at a national brewing festival.\n\nBy 1990, Koch had exceeded his business plan multiple times, selling $21.2 million in beer that year. Four years later, revenue topped $128 million.\n\nTo avoid heavy capital investment, Koch began leasing excess capacity at large brewers. That rankled other microbrewers who had made large investments in equipment and felt mass production and marketing was contrary to the ideals of the craft movement, said Tom Acitelli, author of the book ‘‘The Audacity of Hops: The History of America’s Craft Beer Revolution.’’\n\n‘‘He taught consumers what to expect in an American craft beer,’’ Acitelli said. ‘‘It’s easy to look back now and assume it all would have worked out — that good taste would have triumphed — but it wasn’t inevitable, and Jim Koch helped that along, big time.’’\n\nIn 1995, Boston Beer sold shares in an initial public offering at $20 a share.\n\nToday, the company sells more than 2.7 million barrels of beer, cider, and malt beverage under the Sam Adams, Angry Orchard, and Twisted Tea labels.\n\nKoch said he offers one piece of advice to every entrepreneur.\n\n‘‘When you think about starting a business, the chances that it is going to make you rich are very small,’’ he said. ‘‘The chances that it will make you happy are pretty good. So when you go start a business, pick one that is going to make you happy.’’",

        "instruction": "CHICAGO, Dec. 31— Local pols have been going to prison for selling their offices, souls and almost everything else not nailed down for as long as anyone can remember. But no one around here can recall so many convicted felons trying to make the reverse trip: from prison to politics.\n\nAt least five known former convicts, including a onetime street gang enforcer and a man who tried to hire a killer, are running for the Chicago City Council after spending time behind bars. Technically, they are breaking the law again.\n\nAccording to a quirky Illinois law on the books for just two years, anyone convicted of a felony is ineligible to run for municipal office, including Chicago's 50-member City Council, a legendary den of sticky fingers. But the law does allow a convicted felon to run for governor and other offices.\n\n\"Under this law,\" said Walter Burnett Jr., one of the convicts turned candidate, \"Nelson Mandela, if he lived in Chicago, couldn't be an alderman because he did time. That's crazy.\"\n\nLocal politics have long been a little zany. Around the turn of the century, when Chicago was as wide open as a smashed jewelry store window, there were aldermen who served two terms concurrently -- one on the City Council and one in prison, said Paul M. Green, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Administration at Governors State University in University Park, Ill.\n\n\"Those were the golden years of corruption,\" Mr. Green said. \"But I don't think there has been a time when so many ex-cons were running for office like this. The number is a little startling.\"\n\nMr. Green said that until a few days ago he had never heard of the law. It was passed with little fanfare, apparently, he said, because \"there were some people who were worried about ex-gang members running against them.\"\n\nThe felon law was an amendment to an older, more narrow law that said a person convicted in an Illinois court of \"malfeasance in office, bribery or other corrupt crimes\" was ineligible to run for alderman. The amendment expanded the law to include all convicted felons.\n\n\"I would say morality is not a key factor in any of this,\" Mr. Green said. \"It's politics. But if the people want ex-cons representing them, it should be left up to them to decide in the voting booth.\"\n\nOther municipalities are not so stringent about the backgrounds of their candidates. In Washington, Marion S. Barry Jr. served time for cocaine possession, and last month he got his old job back as Mayor.\n\nIn Chicago, there are 278 candidates for alderman, but the five former convicts are receiving the most news coverage by far.\n\nLouis Farina is a convicted felon but he is not running for alderman, a job he held before going to prison for bribery in the mid-1980's. Mr. Farina, 71, now works for the Safer Foundation, a group that helps former criminals adjust to freedom.\n\n\"When does an ex-offender's punishment cease?\" Mr. Farina asked. \"This law is unconstitutional. It's unethical. It's amoral. When a man comes out of prison, he should be restored to the full rights of every individual walking the streets of this country. We're taking away the incentive for them to go straight.\"\n\nOnly one of the candidates who served time, Tom Hendrix, has been challenged and is in danger of being thrown off the ballot as a result of the law. The city's Board of Elections will decide whether he remains on the ballot, and then the courts will probably become involved.\n\nMr. Hendrix, 37, has not had great luck in court. In 1983, he served 30 months in Federal prison on charges of conspiracy to solict murder for hire. \"I was foolish,\" he said. \"I paid my price. You learn from your mistake, and you go on and live your life.\"\n\nHe said his experiences have sharpened his insights on crime and punishment. \"I know the pros and cons and what to avoid,\" he said.\n\nTwo other former convicts running for office, Tryone Kenner and Wallace Davis Jr., have tasted public power before. Both were sent to prison for bribery and corruption while serving on the City Council.\n\nAnother candidate, Wallace (Gator) Bradley, who went to prison for armed robbery and burglary, was an enforcer for Chicago's largest street gang, the Gangster Disciples. Now, he says, he has become an urban-style Jimmy Carter, forging truces between warring gangs.\n\nMr. Bradley and Mr. Kenner will be fighting it out in the elections in February. Both are running in the city's Third Ward against the incumbent, Dorothy Tillman, a former aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. No other ward has two known convicted felons running.\n\nDick Simpson, a political science professor and a former alderman, said that in the last 25 years 18 or 19 seated aldermen had been sent to prison. But he said he has never heard of a former felon winning local office.That could all change, he added, because some of the incumbent aldermen are weak and ineffective.\n\nTom Leach, a spokesman for the Board of Elections, said that if a former convict won a Council seat, he would be allowed to serve.\n\nMr. Burnett, a diminutive, soft-spoken 31-year-old, was once chairman of the Young Democrats of Cook County and has the backing of what is left of the old Democratic machine.\n\nWhen Mr. Burnett was 17 he robbed a savings and loan association in downstate Illinois with two older men. They were caught and Mr. Burnett spent more than two years in prison, where he earned an associate degree. He is now the administrative assistant to the county's recorder of deeds.\n\nMr. Burnett recently walked through his old housing development, passing out his card and asking for support. \"I don't know if you know,\" he told Shirley Clay. \"I've been in jail before. At the age of 17, I got in trouble with the law.\"\n\n\"That's O.K.,\" Ms. Clay said. \"You been rehabilitated, right?\"\n\n\"I sure have,\" Mr. Burnett said.\n\nA few minutes later, Mr. Burnett shook hands with Reggie Brown, who promised his support, too.\n\n\"Everybody makes mistakes,\" Mr. Brown said after Mr. Burnett had left. \"But maybe I should run. I got a clean record. I ain't never been to jail. You think someone like me would have a chance?\"\n\nAs Mr. Burnett continued his walk through Cabrini Green, people shouted his name from stoops and passing cars, apparently forgiving his past.\n\nGloria Dampier, an assistant manager at a Goodwill store, said if more former convicts came out of prison like Mr. Burnett, \"we wouldn't need prisons pretty soon.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of people who go to jail and come out worse,\" she said. \"He came out a better person.\"\n\nPhoto: Walter Burnett Jr., left, is one of five former convicts in Chicago running for political office.

Among other things, they call for a three-year agreement, instead of a two-year one, and the ending of all specific work quotas.\n\nThe M.T.A. officials said the package was aimed at improving the system's efficiency and at removing restrictions in many areas on management's right to manage.\n\nWith the abolishment of quotas, employees would be required to perform productive work throughout their shift, In addition, there would be no pay for the time off between morning and afternoon bus runs, and restrictions would be removed on the right of management to establish runs, to order overtime and to schedule bids for job picks.\n\nThe authority also seeks to broaden duties under various job titles, such as bus maintainer, stock assistant and cleaner. Parttime employees could be hired for certain jobs, and restrictions limiting the authority's right to schedule vacations would be removed.\n\nOther proposals include giving the authority a free hand in scheduling nonconsecutive days off, eliminating differential pay for weekend work, and restructuring at lower rates the wage levels of certain job classifications.\n\nThese include cleaners, railroad clerks, conductors and trackmen. Incumbents, however, would not have their wage rates reduced. The average hourly wage of transit workers has been $10, according to the authority.\n\nRichard Ravitch, chairman of the authority, said it would make a money offer at a later date. He again characterized demands of the Transport Workers Union and the Amalgamated Transit Union for 25 percent wage increases and other improvements as ''excessive.'' Lawe Voices Exasperation\n\nJohn E. Lawe, president of Local 100 of the T.W.U., which represents 33,000 bus and subway employees in the city, expressed some exasperation at the lengthy rundown of authority proposals and said the union did not take them seriously.\n\nHe reiterated that his union was not going to give up benefits and practices that had been negotiated over the last 40 years. But he said the union was anxious to get down to direct bargaining for a package that would be mutually agreeable and would also help improve the transit system.\n\nMr. Ravitch, Mr.Lawe and William G. Lindner, international president of the Transport Workers Union, said they thought passage by the Legislature last Tuesday of a bill providing for binding arbitration in the event of an impasse would reduce the risk of a strike when the current contracts expire at midnight March 31.\n\nMr. Lawe said the union would not be on the edge of a precipice on April 1, as it has in the past when the contract terminated. He added that he now had an executive board in his union that he felt would agree to bargaining beyond that date if necessary. In the past the union had had a tradition of ''no contract, no work'' that led to the strike that paralyzed transportation in the city for 11 days in April 1980. An End to 'Side Deals'\n\nMr. Ravitch said that in light of the new arbitration law it was ''reasonable to assume'' that there would not be a strike this year. Before yesterday's meeting at the headquarters of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 345 East 46th Street, the chairman of the authority explained that its proposals amounted to an ''entirely new contract'' that ''wipes out 30 years of side agreements and side deals, past practices and arbitration awards and attempts to put in rational form what the understandings between the parties are.''\n\n''It is an attempt to improve management and the efficiency of the railroad,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''It is not an effort to take anything away from the people who work for us but merely to give management the tools to run the system efficiently.''\n\nMr. Lawe, in turn, said the union was willing to cooperate and to make adjustments where necessary, but he warned that if management attempted to take away benefits ''we've had 20 or 30 years, then that story could change in a hurry.''",

        "instruction": "THE proper management of solid, hazardous and nuclear waste is one of the greatest health and environmental challenges of this decade. At present, most efforts to manage these wastes are either shortsighted, ineffective or not responsible, and will not improve unless we, as a society, are willing to recognize the existence and severity of waste management problems and to accept responsibility for managing the wastes we produce.\n\nAll waste must go somewhere - the challenge is to insure that it goes to a site that will manage it properly, and that it does not damage our health or environment.\n\nConnecticut residents produce approximately three and a half pounds of solid waste per person per day, or, statewide, two and one-quarter million tons per year. Each municipality is mandated by state law to provide for the disposal of solid waste generated within its boundaries. Most of this waste is disposed of in landfills, which are quickly filling, and it is extremely difficult to site new landfills.\n\nOf the 169 towns in Connecticut, 58 of them ship solid waste outside their borders for disposal; and it is estimated that by the end of 1985, 105 towns will be forced to dispose of waste beyond their borders. This is no longer a municipal problem; it is a statewide problem.\n\nIn 1973, permissive legislation was enacted for the establishment of regional resource recovery facilities to handle solid waste. Because of technological problems and the statutory inability of state agencies to direct the solid waste stream so that facilities with proven technology could be set up to address a waste shed area's total need, the present approach has not been successful.\n\nStronger, more effective systems of solid waste management must be developed, which include source reduction, source separation, recycling, waste processing and final disposal. Resource recovery facilities are still the best alternative, but the state must first have the cooperation of the municipalities and the legal authority to direct the solid waste stream and to site landfills in order to meet short-term needs.\n\nThe acceptance and implementation of a statewide approach to solid waste management can solve one of our waste problems, but only if it is accomplished soon.\n\nHazardous waste disposal is another example of a waste management problem which poses a major health and environmental threat to this country. We have decided we want products such as dyed clothes, leather shoes, belt buckles and automobiles whose manufacture results in the creation of hazardous waste byproducts, but we have not accepted the responsibility for the proper management and disposal of these wastes.\n\nConnecticut has more than 2,000 industrial plants that produce an annual total of more than 100 million gallons of hazardous waste. Where does this waste go? Most of it is disposed of legally, but an inventory by the State Department of Environmental Protection, not yet completed, has already disclosed hundreds of illegal dump sites.\n\nOur land and water resources are being damaged by the lack of a comprehensive program for hazardous waste management. This is not just an environmental problem; it is a problem that also affects industry, labor and taxpayers.\n\nIf the hazardous waste disposal problem is not solved, industrial expansion will be prevented and industry may even be forced out of the state. This will cost jobs. Taxpayers will bear the immediate financial cost of illegal dump site cleanups and, in the long term, much greater cost of ground-water pollution.\n\nHazardous waste management has two main objectives: to inventory and clean up abandoned sites, and to provide effective ''cradle to grave'' management of hazardous waste. Such management requires the operation of facilities for source reduction, recycling, incineration and landfilling.\n\nThe absence of legal hazardous waste disposal facilities in the state does not insure that hazardous waste is not being produced or that such waste is being transported out-of-state for disposal. It does, however, increase the likelihood of illegal, potentially harmful, in-state disposal. The technology for safe management is available; government and industry must guarantee its implementation.\n\nNuclear waste disposal is Connecticut's newest and most serious waste management problem. Connecticut is the country's ninth largest generator of low-level nuclear waste.\n\nThat waste is produced by utilities, industry, the Federal Government and medical and educational institutions. Only three states have active disposal facilities - South Carolina, Nevada and Washington. Most of Connecticut's waste is shipped to South Carolina, but that facility has reduced the amount of waste it accepts by 50 percent since 1979 and may soon be limited to a regional facility.\n\nThe Federal Government has traditionally pre-empted the states in most areas of nuclear regulation but in 1980 Congress placed the responsibility for low-level radioactive waste disposal with the individual states, who are not prepared to accept this responsibility.\n\nThe public is not aware of the serious gap that now exists between our immediate need for proper nuclear waste disposal and existing, effective disposal methods. The social, environmental and economic questions concerning the storage and disposal of nuclear waste and the public's role in the decisions are monumental issues that must be more clearly understood before they can even begin to be addressed.\n\nThe issue is not whether society will produce wastes; we have decided that we want or need many things that result in their production. Both the harmful effect of improper waste disposal on the environment and the close connection between environment and health are becoming increasingly evident.\n\nThe challenge is to balance our capacity to generate wastes with our ability to manage them responsibly. --------------------------------------------------------------------- John W. Anderson is the Deputy State Commissioner of Environmental Protection.\n\nIllustrations: photo of polluted water at Bristol dump site",

        "output": "THE proper management of solid, hazardous and nuclear waste is one of the greatest health and environmental challenges of this decade.  At present, most efforts to manage these wastes are either shortsighted, ineffective or not responsible, and will not improve unless we, as a society, are willing to recognize the existence and severity of waste management problems and to accept responsibility for managing the wastes we produce.   All waste must go somewhere - the challenge is to insure that it goes to a site that will manage it properly, and that it does not damage our health or environment.   Connecticut residents produce approximately three and a half pounds of solid waste per person per day, or, statewide, two and one-quarter million tons per year. Each municipality is mandated by state law to provide for the disposal of solid waste generated within its boundaries. Most of this waste is disposed of in landfills, which are quickly filling, and it is extremely difficult to site new landfills."

The other half is paid on 31 January.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) warned that anyone who failed to renew their tax credits could be in danger of having payments stopped, or find themselves paying more than they needed to.\n\n\"It is great that millions of people have renewed their tax credits or reported changes so far, but anyone who has not done so yet should take action now - it only takes a few minutes to renew online,\" said Nick Lodge, of HMRC.\n\nRenewals can now also be completed via smartphone apps.

All drowned.'' His voice cracked and he walked away long enough to regain his composure.\n\nA short while later, the man was laughing with relatives at the village of Salaam, a new Nubian settlement not far from the mammoth rock temples of Abu Simbel, whose towering statues of Ramses II were painstakingly sawed into sections and moved high up on a rock face to save them from inundation by Lake Nasser.\n\nSalaam is one of four nascent villages for Nubians who were forced to move more than 160 miles to the Aswan area when their village was flooded and who are now returning to an area as close to their original village as possible.\n\nThe Government is helping them and many seem pleased. Fields Are Irrigated\n\n''This is my history,'' Mohammed Lilab, the leader of Salaam's 150 settlers, said. ''This is my past and my present - this is our own land.''\n\nMr. Lilab was sitting in a straw lean-to with a dozen or so villagers, sipping midday coffee. Nearby, in fields irrigated by water pumped up from the lake, peanuts, potatoes, beans and other vegetables were sprouting.\n\nThere are cows, sheep and chickens. New houses, built in the old way with private courtyards, guest quarters and air holes high in the walls to catch whatever breeze there is, are being built.\n\nSalaam was begun two years ago with the cultivation of 10 acres; now there are 150 acres. Both livestock and settlers are increasing. The settlers were dissatisfied with life in the Aswan area, particularly with cultivating sugar cane, a notoriously difficult crop to harvest.\n\nTraditional to the Nubian culture are date palms. In the old days, a man's wealth was reckoned by how many he owned. They figured in marriage ceremonies and were made into colorful mats for household decoration and plates. Concern for the Culture\n\nSmall date palms are sprouting in Salaam, and the gathering of men unanimously roared ''No!'' when asked if there were plans to plant sugar cane.\n\n''We wanted to re-establish in our old area,'' Mr. Lilab said, ''because we started losing our culture and our history and the young started forgetting and wanted to move on.''\n\n''The United Nations, which restored the temples, should do something to help restore Nubian culture in the area,'' he said, adding, ''We're not forgetting what the Government in doing - they're doing their best.''\n\nThe villagers cooperatively own heavy farm equipment and a generator. They work each other's fields together. Mr. Lilab stared at the fields and the rocky hills in the distance, and commented on a deafening roar overhead. ''Mirage,'' he said, referring to the French-made Egyptian jet fighter, not the optical illusion experienced in the desert.\n\nThe man, who left Adendan in 1963, went in a small fishing boat across Lake Nasser's vastness to the western side of the lake, a tri pthat took thr ee hours in the slow vessel.\n\nIn the old days the Nile, which coursed ribbonlike through the area, could be crossed in a few minutes. On the western side, 38 people are building houses. Corn, peanuts and watermelons are being grown on 50 acres of cultivated land that is expected to increase to 800 acres within a year. With more acres planted, a villager said, more settlers will come back to the old area. This new settlement is called Adendan, and it is recruiting from the Aswan area, where a village called New Adendan was built when the dam was built.\n\nMr. Lilab stood under a peerless blue sky with a mild breeze ruffling his galabia, and said with a smile, ''After thousands of years we couldn't leave this easily.''",

The computation made the point that, even though he had paid at the lower Pennsylvania rates for several years while his family lived in New York City, his New York payments since he switched his official address had been considerable.\n\n''It was in 1969 that we decided to raise our family in New York,'' says his campaign biography.

The authority stopped accepting the buses last month after three riders sustained minor injuries when the doors opened unexpectedly.\n\n''They've developed a new, heavier mechanism that we are prepared to accept for evaluation,'' said Andrew G. Schiavone, the head of the authority's bus division. 'No Cost to the City'\n\nFrank Cronin, the public information director of G.M.'s Truck and Coach Division, said that the mechanism would be installed in the 220 buses awaiting delivery in Pontiac, Mich., and that the 942 buses already in the city would also get the device.\n\n''We plan on retrofitting all of the buses New York has and will have in service - at no cost to the city,'' Mr. Cronin said. It could be several months, however, before all the repairs are made, and officials cautioned passengers not to lean against the rear doors or stand in the stairwells. Prevents Bus From Moving\n\nThe problem involves the components that control the doors, which are pushed outward by passengers. The mechanism is supposed to prevent the bus from moving when the doors are open.\n\nMr. Schiavone of the Transit Authority said complications stemming from the need for wider and heavier doors, to accommodate wheelchair lifts, had caused the malfunction.\n\nMr. Cronin of General Motors agreed that the wheelchair lift was a factor, but he said that New York's bumpy streets and heavy loads also contributed to the problem. ''We have not experienced the problem in other cities,'' he said. 837 in Service\n\nThere are now 837 G.M. buses on New York streets. Since the problem developed in mid-April, 30 G.M. mechanics have been working to keep them in service. In addition, 105 buses delivered since the problem was detected have been kept idle while the dispute was resolved.\n\nTransit officials said the problem was minor compared with the removal from service nearly two years ago of 637 Grumman Flxible buses because of cracks in their undercarriages.\n\nThe city had to borrow 160 buses from Washington to deal with the shortage that resulted. Once the Grumman buses were fixed, the buses were returned.\n\nJohn D. Simpson, the Transit Authority's president, provided a footnote to the Grumman story the other day when he announced that two of New York's buses would soon be sent to Washington. What happened, he said, was that only 158 of the 160 borrowed buses had been returned. One had been stolen, he said, and the other badly damaged in an accident.",

Durst has begun negotiations with Bernstein to either buy his piece of the site or enter into a joint development agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Nasdaq-Amex is still keeping its options open and has hired Cushman & Wakefield for advice.

Jordan, chairman of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, promised yesterday to rebuild the recently acquired CBS Inc. and move the beleaguered network into new business areas like cable television and international broadcasting.\n\nMr. Jordan said at a news conference that the combination of CBS and Westinghouse would \"produce a sense of dynamism and excitement,\" but he offered few specifics of future decisions, other than to say he would retain much of CBS's top management. He said \"time will tell\" what vision he would bring to CBS, adding that \"a strategic plan\" was \"something that will evolve.\"\n\nIn an interview later, Mr. Jordan identified CBS's three main priorities as \"ratings, ratings and ratings,\" adding that \"even a modest turnaround in the entertainment ratings for the network's programs will flow money to the bottom line.\"\n\nMr. Jordan said that some personnel would be cut in the combined companies in \"areas that overlap\" and that those decisions would be made in the next 60 days. He also said that Westinghouse would announce the sale of some nonbroadcasting assets \"within several weeks.\" He declined to identify the assets.\n\nThe management team at CBS will continue to be headed by Peter Lund, who yesterday was named president and chief executive of CBS Inc. Leslie Moonves will continue to run the network's entertainment division and will add the title of executive vice president of CBS Inc. Bill Korn, formerly the chief broadcasting executive at Westinghouse, was named executive vice president of CBS Inc. and president of the newly combined station group, which will become the nation's largest, with 15 television and 32 radio stations.\n\nTwo CBS managers were replaced: Jonathan Rogers, who was head of CBS's television stations, and Nancy Widmann, who was in charge of CBS Radio. Their jobs will now be handled by Jonathan Klein and Dan Mason, both former Westinghouse executives.\n\nThe fate of many other CBS division heads was left unresolved, including that of Eric Ober, president of CBS News. Asked specifically about Mr. Ober, whose ouster has been the subject of widespread rumors in recent weeks, Mr. Lund said he would meet with CBS's managers in the coming days. \"Then we'll decide whether we have all the right people in the right jobs,\" he said. \"There may be a change in any job.\"\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission last week approved Westinghouse's $5.4 billion purchase of CBS, which has seen its ratings plummet during the last two years. The network is now consistently a distant third to NBC and ABC and almost always finishes fourth to Fox in ratings among younger adult viewers, who are the most sought after by advertisers.\n\nMr. Lund said future staff cuts would not represent \"a plan to cost-cut our way to success, but instead would only relate to areas where the combined companies overlap.\" He mentioned human resources, corporate and division employees as areas of likely overlap. \"These's no mandate to start downsizing,\" he said.\n\nMr. Jordan said: \"Anything that has to do with people we want to do quickly. We want to get the organizational issues sorted out so that people are not on tenterhooks wondering where they're going to be.\"\n\nIn the interview in a CBS conference room adjacent to his new office (which was once occupied by William S. Paley, the founder of CBS) Mr. Jordan said the absence of specific announcements yesterday was to be expected. \"At first it all sounds like boilerplate,\" he said. \"It's not very exciting, but that's how you make money.\"\n\nCBS will make money, he said, first through better programs and ultimately though the powerful assembly of its radio and television station lineup. \"Nobody talks about radio,\" Mr. Jordan said, but he cited the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, a rival whose lineup of radio stations he called a $2 billion entity.\n\n\"Radio has better revenue growth\" than television, Mr. Jordan said. \"It's more flexible and it's easier to turn around. It's a great franchise we can build on. Most people haven't focused on that because of the current fixation on content, which translates into glamour and personalities like Dreamworks and other studios and Ted Turner. But the nitty-gritty of broadcasting can make a you a lot of money.\"\n\nMr. Jordan said the two New York radio stations with all-news formats now owned by the merged company, Westinghouse's WINS and WCBS, might survive as competitors of sorts \"because they serve different segments of the audience.\" But he added that the stations might combine support staffs.\n\nPhoto: The CBS management team was introduced by Michael H.

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 7— While reviewing personnel matters, President Reagan heard a week ago that one of his Cabinet members wanted to retain a Carter Administration official in a key position.\n\n''I thought we weren't going to do that,'' Mr. Reagan snapped, to which an aide replied that the person was highly qualified and was the choice of the President's own appointee. ''I thought we weren't going to do that,'' Mr. Reagan said again, with a trace of annoyance.\n\nThe man was not kept. This story was recounted by E. Pendleton James, assistant to the President for personnel, to illustrate a point: It is Mr. Reagan, more than anyone else, who is wielding the broom to sweep the Federal Government clean of holdovers from previous administrations, no matter who they are.\n\nOne result is that scientists, economists and other technical or professional appointees have been asked to submit their resignations even if they have not engaged in political activities this year. Some of these same people are barred from political activities by the Hatch Act. No 'Political Hacks'\n\n''We're not doing this for personal vengeance, or with any penalty in mind,'' Mr. James said in an interview this week. ''Ronald Reagan was elected to change the Government. Change doesn't mean you politicize the place. It doesn't mean we're going to bring in political hacks or substandard appointees. It means that, in order to carry out his mandate, the President needs to bring in his own team.''\n\nThe Reagan personnel operation has churned out about 100 appointments -somewhat behind schedule but not enough to deter Mr. James and his aides from insuring that the selections be filtered through his office. The personnel office's staff of 54 makes it one of the largest components of the White House.\n\nThe existence of the operation is testimony to the determination of the President, and his former campaign aides, to command the loyalty of even the lowliest appointees in the Reagan Administration.\n\nThus Mr. James's office is responsible for filling, or at least granting final approval, for 750 Cabinet and sub-Cabinet jobs, nearly 1,000 additional senior management positions jobs in various agencies, nearly 200 jobs in independent regulatory agencies, and perhaps a third of the 140 United States ambassadorships. Boards and Commissions\n\nIn addition, the White House plans to submit its own names for 255 boards and commissions under the President's authority and the hundreds of additional boards in different agencies. Recently, Mr. James found out, for example, that there were 120 boards and commissions in the Interior Department alone.\n\nMr. James said he hoped to eliminate many of the boards and commissions outright ,but conceded that President Reagan might well prefer to keep some of the marginally useful panels to fill them with his own appointees.\n\nWhite House officials concede that they have heard some grumbling from many of the dismissed personnel, but they point out that there has also been grumbling from people who worked in Mr. Reagan's campaign and who feel that they have been left out so far.\n\nAt the State Department, for example, several longtime officials are being removed from their jobs even though their careers extend back through many administrations. But others are upset that more political people have not been asked to take jobs. More Campaign Aides Sought\n\nRecently, James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, urged personnel officials to redouble their efforts to hire people from the campaign. He also asked the same thing for blacks, women, Hispanic Americans and other groups that have begun complaining about being unrepresented.\n\nIn an interview, several Reagan aides conceded that many former campaign aides were fuming, but they said many others had been hired already. Included among them were Mr. James's two deputies, Richard Shelby and Wayne Roberts, campaign directors for the Middle West and New England, respectively.\n\nAmong the most controversial of Mr. Reagan's personnel moves was his decision to remove even nonpolitical holdovers from the Carter Administration. This was the step to dismiss 15 ''inspectors general'' in Cabinet agencies, all of whom had been chosen for their lack of ties to politics.\n\nAnother controversial category consists of the 500 people in the so-called senior executive service. Many of these are ''career'' or Civil Service employes who had been in government for years but who were elevated to their current jobs because the Carter Administration wanted to reward them for their performance.\n\nOnce dismissed, such officials are entitled to be moved to other positions in the Government, but they are to be removed from their current jobs nonetheles.\n\n''I'm sure many of them are dedicated, loyal citizens,'' Mr. James said. ''But if they serve at the pleasure of the President and are Presidential appointees they are going to go. There will be some exceptions made on a case-by-case basis, but the President wants change, and he is jolly well going to get it.''",

HSBC said Tuesday that it is committed to complying with the law.\n\nCourt estimates show about 25,000 foreclosure cases statewide have languished for months because lenders have delayed filing the papers to trigger a conference while continuing to assess interest, fees, and penalties, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said.

It also seeks damages for homeowners.\n\n‘‘Companies like HSBC are brazenly ignoring state law, leaving homeowners across New York stuck in a legal limbo where they can’t even get the legally required settlement conference that could help them keep their homes,’’ Schneiderman said. ‘‘For homeowners facing foreclosure, time is their greatest enemy.

In addition, US banking overseers must also complete new capital standards mandated in the international Basel III accords next year.\n\nThe industry’s main worry is that the rules may overlap or conflict, creating what National Association of Realtors president Maurice Veissi called a perfect storm of regulation.\n\n‘‘There’s this intersection of policies that are absolutely not being considered by this massive array of institutions, all involved in deciding the future of homeownership and rental opportunity,’’ David Stevens, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said in a speech Monday in Chicago.\n\nMortgage credit is already tight. US regulators, including Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke, have expressed concern that banks are preventing qualified borrowers from taking advantage of record-low rates.\n\nJames Parrott, a member of President Obama’s National Economic Council, told mortgage bankers that the administration is still concerned.\n\n‘‘How do you correct for what happened in 2005, but not do so in such a way that we’re stuck where we are today, where there’s not nearly enough liquidity?’’ Parrott said.\n\nBorrowers whose loans closed in September had an average credit score of 750, placing them in the top 40 percent of Americans, according to Ellie Mae, which provides automation solutions for the mortgage industry.\n\nConsumer advocates say the industry’s fears are overblown. ‘‘All of these rules are reactions to the failure to regulate at all over the last decade,’’ said Alys Cohen, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nThe next few months will usher in a new phase of the government response to the financial crisis of 2008 as regulators begin to unveil exactly how they will set limits intended to prevent another housing bubble.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is briefing other regulators about its plans for the qualified mortgage rule, which will require lenders to determine borrowers’ ability to repay loans. If banks meet the standards for a nonabusive mortgage , they’ll be offered a degree of legal protection.\n\nLenders say they’ll probably make only the safest mortgages as defined by the rule, commonly known as the QM regulation, after it is issued.\n\nOnce the QM rule is set, regulators will write a second measure: the qualified residential mortgage rule, or QRM rule, which will require lenders to retain stakes in risky mortgages when they wrap them into securities.\n\nAt the same time, regulators have proposed standards under the Basel III agreement that would require banks to hold more capital against risky mortgages. The MBA wrote a letter urging regulators to abandon their Basel III proposal on the grounds that it would hurt lending.\n\nConsumer advocates say they agree that the rules are complex and must be carefully calibrated. However, they say, the mortgage industry needs to be more judicious with its complaints.",

        "instruction": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Antwain Black was facing a few more years in Leavenworth for dealing crack. But on Tuesday, he returned home to Illinois, a free man.\n\nBlack, 36, was among the first of potentially thousands of inmates who are being released early from federal prison because of an easing of the harsh penalties for crack that were enacted in the 1980s, when the drug was a terrifying new phenomenon in America's cities.\n\n\"I did more than enough time,\" Black said outside his family's Springfield, Ill., home, where family and friends had gathered to celebrate over dinner. \"I feel like I can win this time. I'm a better man today than I was then.\"\n\nThe 1980s-era federal laws punished crack-related crimes much more severely than those involving powdered cocaine – a practice criticized as racially discriminatory because most of those convicted of crack offenses were black.\n\nMore recently, the penalties for crack were reduced to bring them more in line with those for powder, and Tuesday was the first day inmates locked up under the old rules could get out early.\n\nSome 12,000 prisoners are expected to benefit from reduced sentences over the next several years, with an estimated 1,900 eligible for immediate release as of Tuesday. On average, inmates will get three years shaved off their sentences. The reductions do not apply to people found guilty of crack offenses under state laws.\n\nBlack said like many of his peers, he started smoking crack in high school and began selling it partly to support his habit. He said he was a low-level dealer and that he didn't realize the mandatory minimum sentence he faced when he pleaded guilty in 2003 and was given a 15-year prison term.\n\nWith changes in the law, good behavior and credit for time served in jail, he was freed from the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan., after 8 1/2 years locked up for the crime. His projected release had been Oct. 3, 2013.\n\n\"I didn't think it was fair and I still don't think it's fair now,\" Black said. \"I know guys who aren't coming home, still, because of these laws that were placed upon a certain race of people,\" he said.\n\nKentucky inmate Darryl Flood, 48, thought he would have to wait until 2013 to get out of prison, more than a decade after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute crack. But on Monday a judge approved his release two years ahead of schedule.\n\nSusan Cardwell, his sister in Haymarket, Va., said she was expecting him to arrive on a bus on Wednesday. She said she cried after getting a call from his lawyer with the news.\n\n\"He wants to get out, get a job and get his life back together,\" she said in a telephone interview. \"He says he'll work two jobs if he has to.\"\n\nUnder the old system, a person convicted of crack possession got the same mandatory prison term as someone with 100 times the amount of powdered cocaine. Five grams of crack, about the weight of five packets of Sweet N'Low, brought a mandatory five years; it took 500 grams of powder to get the same sentence.\n\nThe law was seen as racially unfair because blacks made up the majority of people convicted of crack crimes, while whites were more likely to be found guilty of offenses involving powdered cocaine.\n\nIn 2010, Congress reduced the disparity in sentences for future cases. Last summer, the U.S. Sentencing Commission decided to apply the measure to inmates doing time under the old rules.\n\nChris Burke, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said that he could not say exactly how many people would be let out Tuesday but that officials were working around the clock to process hundreds of orders from judges granting early release. In certain cases, prison officials have been given a grace period of several days to free inmates, Burke said.\n\nThe releases are the result of months of work by prosecutors, public defenders and judges across the country. Inmates' requests for sentence reductions were decided on a case-by-case basis, with courts taking into consideration such factors as the prisoner's behavior behind bars and threat to society.\n\nIn San Antonio, the federal public defender's office reported that it had about 15 to 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. In St. Louis, the office said it submitted 30 to 50 petitions asking for inmates to be set free right away.\n\nIn the eastern district of Virginia, which has the highest number of affected inmates anywhere in the country, public defender Michael Nachmanoff said that judges had ordered the immediate release of about 75 people.\n\nBlack, who earned a high school equivalency diploma and college credits behind bars, likes to cook and hopes to open a restaurant.\n\n\"It's a blessing just to see them smile, for me to be home\" he said, referring to the friends and family who welcomed him home. \"It lets me know I am loved. It's been a long ride, too. It's been a while. They held fast for me. I've got a lot of people counting on me so I've got to fly right this time.\"\n\nJessica Gresko contributed from Washington.",

After the last out, Ziegler decided he was going to try to find the woman in the stadium parking lot.\n\nWith odds stacked heavily against him, Ziegler played amateur detective, darting through thousands of fans leaving that afternoon's A's game in search of a stranger.\n\n\"I circled it four times,\" Ziegler told the Arizona Republic. \"It was after the game, so there were a lot of people filtering out, but I remembered what she was wearing and what her friend was wearing so whenever I saw them I knew right away, even though it was across the parking lot. I was like, 'There they are.'\"\n\nHer name is Kristen, and she was at the game with an old college friend she hadn't seen in years. Let's just say Kristen was a tiny bit surprised when an unfamiliar person approached.\n\n\"We were in the parking lot and my girlfriend was talking to a couple people that she met and this car pulled up behind us,\" Kristen explained to the Arizona Republic. \"I was like, 'Well, I don't know anybody here, I don't live in Arizona, so it must be Maria's friend.' Maria looked over and was like, 'I don't know who that is. I don't know that person.' He kind of motioned, 'Come here' with his hand and we were both (unsure, but we went over.)\"\n\nThe women didn't realize right away that Zeigler was a player. Yet after some small talk they made arrangements to meet later that night. To say it went well would be a pretty big understatement. \"He and I really just hit it off, not necessarily in the dating sense because Brad and I started out as friends,\" Kristen said.\n\nThe rest of the story: Brad and Kristen got married in 2011. In fact, the Zieglers tied the knot on 11/11/11 (her favorite number is 11) and they had 111 wedding guests.

She almost canceled her trip to Arizona, but a friend talked her into the weekend visit. Kristen also was leaving the state the very next day, so the couple ended up spending lots of time on the phone and, as she pointed out, were friends before they dated seriously.\n\nZiegler, a relief pitcher, was traded from Oakland to the Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2011 season. He pitched in the National League Divisional Series for Arizona.\n\nPopular Stories On ThePostGame: -- The Day Cars Of Race Car Drivers -- Jeff Demps Runs From Gridiron Toward Gold -- Charl Schwartzel's Green Jacket Hang-Up -- Two Things Danica Patrick Won't Tell Fans",

But he did so on something of a cheat.\n\nAround Thanksgiving, Brooks smashed Pearl Jam's old record for the most sales racked up by an album in its debut week, moving 1,085,000 to the Seattle band's 950,000 for \"Vs.,\" earned in '93.\n\nFine. Except that in the same week, one of the industry's biggest record suppliers changed the way it tallies its sales figures for SoundScan enough to push Brooks ahead of PJ. The Handleman company, which supplies albums to all Kmart and many Wal-Mart stores, had been counting its albums from Saturday to the following Friday. Most others count them from Monday to the following Sunday.\n\nThe difference is crucial to debut-week sales. Since new albums arrive in stores on Tuesdays, the old Handleman policy of cutting off their tallies on the Friday of that week sacrificed a new album's first weekend. While these things even out by the next week, it irrevocably hurt debuts.\n\nHandleman talked about making its policy conform to the rest of the industry last summer. While it makes sense that it would take the company some time to put that talk into practice, some industry sources find it suspicious that the company just happened to begin the new accounting on the same week Garth stood to break PJ's record something the country star announced as his goal. Handleman did not return calls.\n\nHandleman's power shouldn't be underestimated. For instance, due to the change on the busy week before Thanksgiving, overall album sales increased 20% from the previous week. Of that increase, 25% was due to the new accounting by Handleman, according to a source.\n\nAlso, consider the fact that a singnificant portion of Brooks' fans shop at discount outlets like Kmart and Wal-Mart. Consider too that Brooks had a deal with Wal-Mart to perform a concert for the chain, beamed to every store via satellite the day the album was released.\n\nAn informed source says that by adding in the first weekend, Handleman's outlets doubled their sales of Garth's album, enough to give him the top debut.\n\nA Brooks' spokesman denies any coordination between their camp and Handleman. Yet he says the accounting change does mean Pearl Jam and Garth should be seen separately.\n\n\"Pearl Jam's record will always stand for the way Soundscan originally did their accounting. But now there's a new way of doing things, so currently Garth holds the record for that,\" says Scott Stem.\n\nIn other words, call it a win on a technicality.\n\nIN OTHER CHART NEWS: The once mighty rap group Cypress Hill seems on the decline. Its new release, \"IV,\" dropped to No. 176 in nine weeks, after selling 294,000 copies. At this rate, it won't come anywhere near the level of the group's earlier LPs: 1995's \"Temple of Boom,\" which sold 1.1 million, '93's \"Black Sunday,\" 2.7 million, or '91's \"Cypress Hill,\" 1.7 mil.

        "instruction": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- DAVID YEADON is the author and illustrator of \"Hidden Corners of Britain\" and \"Backroad Journeys of Southern Europe,\" both published this year. ------------\n\nMore than 20 years after first reading \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\" I finally made the journey to the Thomas Hardy country of southern Dorset. I went looking for \"Egdon Heath\" - \"grand in its simplicity...that g reat inviolate place of ancient permanence,\" haunt of Tess, Michael H enchard, Gabriel Oak, Sergeant Troy, Bathsheba and a score of the i mmortal Hardy creations. I found a region of open moorlands, w riggling lanes, chalk downlands and hamlets of thatch-roofed houses w ith such names as Child Okeford and Toller Porcorum. Hardy country,a lthough it lies close to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and B ournemouth and is only a three-hour dirve southwest from London, is a true place apart.\n\nPerhaps more than any other 19th-century novelist, Hardy used landscapes, seasons and the ever-changing moods of weather as backgrounds for his dramas. He loved the bold sweeps and vistas of Dorset and populated real towns and places with imaginary people frequently at loggerheads with themselves and the elements. Dorchester became his Casterbridge, Weymouth became Budmouth, Bere Regis became Kings Bere, and dainty Puddletown, Weatherbury.\n\nI began my explorations early one fall morning at the cottage in which Hardy was born (in 1840) at Higher Bockhampton. A trail from the town's car park wound through woodlands to a lane smelling of roses. On the right a path climbed up a shallow valley edged in heather and gorse to the open tops of \"Egdon Heath\" and the ancient burial mounds of Rainbarrows. On my left was the cottage, set in a garden brimming with ferns, shrubs and honeysuckle arbors.\n\nThe cottage is maintained by the National Trust and occupied by a tenant of the trust, Anna Winchcombe, who acts as caretaker and guide. I had called in advance to arrange my visit (see box) and Anna welcomed me with a cup of tea. Then, as we walked slowly through the cottage, she told of the author's solitary hikes over the moors, his frantic fiddle-playing at local dances and his fears of growing up.\n\nThe men in his family were stonemasons and they built the house themselves in 1800. The seven rooms are small, low-beamed and sparsely furnished with plain period pieces. The study contains a cabinet of Hardy's books translated into 151 languages.\n\nAnna, a devotee of the man whose Wessex novels have made this corner of Dorset the epitome of rural England, signed a copy of her book, \"Thomas Hardy - A Wayfarer,\" and suggested a circular route through the lanes and byways of Hardy country. The route was less than 30 miles long and yet encompassed most of what she called his \"old, loved places,\" including Dorchester, which is the hub of the area and figures in much of his writing.\n\nI started out in Dorchester, staying at the King's Arms on High Street, an old-fashioned Regency-flavored hotel. On the first day I explored this busy market town of towers and old comfortable inns on its hill above the River Frome. Hardy worked for six years here as a trainee architect at 36 South Street. But it was as a novelist that he immortalized Dorchester - as Casterbridge - when his first successful book, \"Under the Greenwood Tree,\" was published in 1872. Almost every place of note in the community was featured, including the King's Arms, \"the chief hotel in Casterbridge,\" approached across the old town bridge \"of weather-stained brick\" - now replaced by a more contemporary structure.\n\nOn a hill at the southern end of town, past the redolent Eldridge and Pope Brewery, are the Maumbury Rings part of Dorset's neolithic heritage. A broad hollow a hundred yards across was originally created as a stone circle or \"henge\" and later modified by the Romans for use as an amphitheater. I climbed the steep, grassy sides and looked southward toward Weymouth and the Isle of Portland. The suburbs of Dorchester gave way to farms and long windbreaks of trees and then, rising in tiers, about three miles away, I could see the earthworks of Maiden Castle. This spot was the haunt of Henchard, the Mayor of Casterbridge, where he secretly watched his stepdaughter and Farfrae through an old, worn telescope.\n\nHardy loved the contrast between the cozy clustering of the town and the enormous open profile of 2,000-year-old fortifications more than two miles around. A maze of miniature ravines with steep grass slopes, some almost 100 feet high, enclose a flat hilltop that was occupied by the Britons until the Roman occupation in A.D. 43. Access to it is clearly signed from Dorchester and a display of finds can be seen at the County Museum on High Street (open Monday to Saturday, 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 2 to 5 P.M.; admission $1).\n\nI wandered back into town and followed the path along the Frome. The river curls around the base of a wooded cliff, and a red-faced middle-aged man was wading through the shallows with a scythe, clearing segments of river weed. The path crosses a bridge and widens into a lane that passes Hangman's Cottage, where, Hardy recalled, as a 16-year-old he climbed the fence and peered in at the hangman eating supper the night before an execution. (The cottage is not open to the public).",

        "instruction": "BECAUSE of rising expenses and fear of crime, the all-night drugstore is a disappearing amenity. When a prescription needs to be filled at night, county residents face an often-futile search that may end only at the emergency room of a hospital.\n\nAccording to Dr. Albert J. Sica, executive secretary of the New York State Board of Pharmacy in Albany, ''There are no state laws that address the subject of emergency hours.'' An inspector for the board added, ''There is nothing in the law that says we can compel any number of pharmacies to stay open.'' Nor are there any county laws pertaining to the subject.\n\nSome Westchester drugstores are open until 9 P.M. weekdays, with shorter hours on weekends. But after 9, it is difficult to find an open pharmacy. John G. Palmieri, president of the Westchester County Pharmaceutical Society and the owner of a drugstore in Katonah, said: ''I used to close at 9 P.M., but now I close at 7:30. We get phone calls, but we're afraid that they may lead to a robbery. It scares a lot of us.''\n\nAlfred Vitrione said that the hours at his Saint John Pharmacy in Yonkers were longer than most: even on Sundays his store is open until 9 P.M. But he is reluctant to answer emergency calls after those hours. In the past, fearing a robbery, he has asked the police to meet him at the store after he had received an emergency telephone call from someone he did not know.\n\nIn addition to fear of crime, pharmacists cited higher expenses, mentioning not only such overhead costs as electricity, heat and salaries but also a state law that requires a registered pharmacist to be ''in attendance'' whenever a drugstore is open.\n\nThe lack of emergency service during the hours when the pharmacy is closed also appears to stem from past abuses of the service. Several pharmacists recalled the annoyance of being called out to answer calls that did not involve emergencies.\n\n''One time, I got out of bed for a hot-water bottle, and another time I went there in the middle of the night and the patient didn't even show up,'' Mr. Palmieri said. Mr. Vitrione spoke of ''the times I was called to reopen because somebody needed a bottle of aspirin.''\n\nSome of the pharmacists who are willing to serve on an emergency basis put signs in their windows with telephone numbers, but many say that they try to reserve the service for regular customers. For the same reason, some who have telephone-answering services expressed reluctance to advertise that fact.\n\nThe greatest difficulty for patients is finding out where emergency pharmacy service is available. There is no organized information network on the subject in the county. The Westchester County Pharmaceutical Society once published a booklet listing pharmacy hours, but it was discontinued about eight years ago because of the cost of updating and reprinting it.\n\nA search through the telephone book's yellow pages may yield the name of a drugstore with 24-hour service, but in many parts of the county no such service is advertised. Calls to local police stations elicit varied responses. A few had lists of pharmacists who were willing to be called in emergencies, but most offered a referral to a nearby hospital.\n\nIn White Plains, Police Chief Patrick Gleason said, ''We have a list for emergency prescriptions.'' But an on-duty officer in the White Plains Police Department said: ''We send them to the hospital emergency room. We have a list of druggists, but most of them won't come.''\n\nRonald Kramer, manager of the Medical Center Pharmacy in White Plains, can be reached on a 24-hour basis. A beeper signals him when a message has been left on his answering machine. The Russell-Bruno Pharmacy in Tuckahoe has a similiar 24-hour emergency beeper service.\n\nMr. Kramer installed his system in 1978, and estimates that it is used almost every week. While some callers are ''just panicked,'' he said, others have ''serious emergencies.'' He was recently called by an asthmatic who needed an inhaler and by the mother of a child with a 105-degree fever and convulsions, whose physician wanted to issue a prescription for phenobarbital elixir.\n\nMr. Kramer said that he always called the prescribing doctor back to verify the order, and insisted that the doctor follow up with a written order to meet legal requirements. In addition to the cost of the prescription, there is a charge for this emergency service of $5 before midnight and $10 after.\n\nSome drugstores are open late or offer emergency service on a rotating basis with others in their vicinity, but the arrangements are seldom advertised. Regular customers could inquire at their pharmacy during normal hours and note the information for use in an emergency.\n\nPatients who are unable to locate emergency pharmacy services and who then go to hospital emergency rooms find a variety of circumstances awaiting them. The White Plains Hospital, for example, directs such patients to the White Plains Medical Center Pharmacy. Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville has a list of on-call pharmacists at the emergency-room desk.\n\nAt Northern Westchester Hospital's Medical Center in Mount Kisco, according to Alan Marino, director of pharmacy, a call from a local physician about a local resident or traveling patient, prescribing an uncontrolled substance, may result in a filled prescription.\n\nFor controlled substances, a more comprehensive evaluation at the emergency room is required. One advantage of this policy is that the patient may pay only a ''medicine dispensing fee,'' which is ''nowhere near the regular emergency room fee,'' Mr. Marino said.\n\nBut most of Westchester's hospitals have no such policy. Even if an earlier prescription is available, the patient is usually examined by an emergency-room physician and charged standard emergency-room fees.",

Doubleday. $14.95.\n\nA MAGAZINE, in spite of what most writers think, requires an editor, and it often seems to help if the editor is a little crazy, at once a monster of egotism and a clump of twitchy nerve-endings, obsessive and compulsive and anal while at the same time given to mystic spasms. He needn't be nice; he doesn't even have to be articulate. He merely consults the compass of himself. It is as if the world leaves thumbprints on his skin. His bruise is news, and there will always be writers around to report it. Editors as various as H.L. Mencken and Harold Ross were difficult people.\n\nJann Wenner, who took $7,500 in 1967 and parlayed it into the $16 million enterprise that is Rolling Stone today, is never going to be accused of being a Mencken or a Ross, even if he is emotionally shaken every time he sees a rerun of ''Citizen Kane.'' He wants too much to get his name in Time magazine and to have lunch with Jacqueline Onassis. It was too important to him that Walter Cronkite show up at the party Rolling Stone gave during the 1976 Democratic National Convention in New York. Great editors are made of sterner stuff. The Spirit Misread\n\nNor can he be said to have read the spirit of his generation in several important particulars. Believing as he did that ''rock and roll can change the world,'' he missed the point of the civil rights movement, and was capable of writing after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that Dr. King's death ''meant little or nothing to the majority of the American people.'' He also missed the point of feminism, perhaps because the readership of Rolling Stone is overwhelmingly male; only after a staff sit-in in his office were women permitted to attend editorial conferences.\n\nHe is, nevertheless, more than just an entrepreneur, the perfect pink child of capitalism triumphant. A good editor lives and dies by his instincts and his writers. ''I like talented people,'' Mr. Wenner once explained. ''You might say I collect them.'' Instinct led him to hire a number of enormously talented people, including Michael Lydon, Jon Landau, Greil Marcus, Joe Eszterhas, Grover Lewis and, of course, Hunter S. Thompson. He let Carl Bernstein get away and underestimated Timothy Crouse, but then Mr. Crouse was also underestimated by a lot of shrewd reporters until they read ''The Boys on the Bus.''\n\nMany of these talented people moved on and some burned out. No matter; that is the nature of writers. It is worthier, and much more fun, to have hired them at the beginning of their careers, when they were as new as the music. These days, Rolling Stone looks for big names in that game of recycling that characterizes so much of its competition, as if the only thing magazine editors read is other magazines.\n\nBut it must have been a riot during the growing years. Robert Sam Anson, who has done time at Time and New Times and WNET-TV, makes it sound that way in this breezy, fact-filled and opinionated book. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, when Ramparts was in bloom, when Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey and Bill Graham and Emmett Grogan were all in San Francisco. Listen to the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane. Contemplate Woodstock and Altamont. Think, if you can, about Patty Hearst.\n\nMr. Anson seems to have interviewed anybody who was somebody in the Rolling Stone saga. We learn as much about the business side of the magazine as we do about the office politics and the cocainesniffing. Everybody seems to agree that without Mr. Wenner, the entire operation would have gone bankrupt. It is hard to be an entrepreneur and a Papa Bear at the same time. Defections from the ''family'' are more like wounds than bruises. Still, Mr. Wenner seems no less sensitive, no less insecure and no less statusconscious than the rest of us. Whether he will choke on the Big Apple remains to be seen. There are seasons for magazines, even the best magazines. Then the Zeitgeist moves on, wearing hobnailed Gucci boots.\n\nIf there is a fault in Mr. Anson's account, it is that he wants Rolling Stone to stand for all of youth culture. It must be the computer printout of the love tribe, whereas it has been at least as much a stock report on record company profits. Somehow, the more politically minded of Rolling Stone writers and editors never got through to Mr. Wenner. When at last he decided that politics might be important, he turned to Richard N. Goodwin, and it was an expensive fiasco. Still Full of Dreamers\n\nAccording to Mr. Anson, the complacency of Rolling Stone today represents ''the failure of a dream.'' Nonsense. There are still dreamers all over the place. Also according to Mr. Anson, ''at bottom, the story of Patty Hearst was the story of a generation writ large.'' Really? Just because Rolling Stone had a scoop on the Symbionese Liberation Army? What about Bob Dylan or Muhammad Ali or Lieutenant Calley? The last two decades have been far more interesting than Patty Hearst.\n\nSo one cavils. Enough. If Mr. Wenner is something less than a combination of Julien Sorel and Henderson the Rain King, and Rolling Stone something less than Martin Luther's 95 theses, ''Gone Crazy and Back Again'' nevertheless entertains as much as it cautions. This is what has become of some of us.",

        "instruction": "NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- A jury began deliberations Wednesday in the trial of a man cast by prosecutors as the mastermind of a brutal attack on a family inside their suburban home following weeks of grisly testimony that left some jurors fighting back tears.\n\nJoshua Komisarjevsky, a paroled burglar, could join his co-defendant on Connecticut's death row if convicted in the attack, in which family members were tied up and left to die in a house fire. While Komisarjevsky has blamed his co-defendant for killing the family, prosecutors said Komisarjevsky was the leader.\n\nJurors deliberated for about four hours and will resume on Thursday.\n\nA judge denied an effort Wednesday by Komisarjevsky's attorneys to reopen their defense based on letters from co-defendant Steven Hayes claiming he had committed numerous murders in the past. They cited letters from Hayes saying he killed 17 people in the Northeast and committed dozens of drugged date rapes. A prosecutor called the letters unreliable.\n\nAuthorities say Komisarjevsky and Hayes broke into a home in Cheshire, Conn., in 2007, beat Dr. William Petit with a bat, tied him and his family up and forced his wife to withdraw money from a bank. The house was doused in gas and set on fire, leading to the girls' deaths from smoke inhalation.\n\nHayes was convicted last year of raping and strangling Jennifer Hawke-Petit and killing her daughters. In his case, jurors deliberated for about five hours over two days before finding him guilty. He is on death row.\n\nKomisarjevsky's trial began Sept. 19 and featured grim evidence, including rope used to bind the family and autopsy photos.\n\nAfter a little more than an hour of deliberations, jurors sent the judge a note asking, \"When giving the verdict, do we need to specify if we have found him guilty as a principal or an accessory?\"\n\nJudge Jon Blue said jurors don't have to specify and that if they find him guilty of a charge, they don't need to be unanimous on whether they believe he's an accessory or principal.\n\nBlue denied a motion for a mistrial by Komisarjevsky's attorneys, who said a prosecution expert sitting close to jurors rolled her eyes seven times in disbelief during defense closing arguments. Blue did call jurors out from the deliberations room to caution them that any facial expressions by spectators are not evidence and should be disregarded.\n\nThe letters came to light just before closing arguments Tuesday in New Haven Superior Court. Komisarjevsky's attorneys say the letters could help their arguments that Hayes orchestrated the crime.\n\nBut Blue said the claims were not corroborated and would actually hurt Komisarjevsky's case because of claims Hayes makes in the letters about the Connecticut crime. Testimony is reopened to avoid miscarriages of justice, he said.\n\nHayes' claims, if true, would make him one of the worst serial killers in American history. But Blue said the claims were vague, with no dates, locations or other details.\n\n\"It certainly means there is no real corroboration of this,\" he said.\n\nSpokesmen for the FBI and Connecticut state police declined to comment Wednesday on whether their agencies are looking into Hayes' murder and rape claims. The state Department of Correction declined a request by The Associated Press to release copies of Hayes' letters, citing Blue's gag order in the case.\n\nThe judge said Hayes would only invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination if called to testify. He said the letters blame Komisarjevsky for much of the home invasion.\n\n\"This would be the seal of Mr. Komisarjevsky's doom,\" Blue said.\n\nHe also denied a defense motion for a mistrial based on comments prosecutors made during closing arguments.\n\nAssociated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report.",

The timing of his exit has yet to be determined, and Stewart did not say what he plans to do afterward.\n\nStewart influenced political and cultural views with some of the brainiest satire that television has seen.\n\n‘‘I think Jon wanted to get this off his chest and put it out there. He’s been carrying this for a little while, and now we’ll have to discuss’’ the next steps, Herzog said. ‘‘He’ll take a deep breath, as will we, and figure out what’s best for Jon Stewart and best for ‘The Daily Show,’ in that order.’’\n\nHe declined to comment on when Stewart, whose contract is up this fall told Comedy Central of his decision to leave.\n\nHerzog said ‘‘there’s a short list’’ of possible Stewart replacements, declining to provide specifics. It’s uncertain whether it includes former ‘‘Daily Show’’ correspondent John Oliver, who moved to HBO after successfully filling in for Stewart when he took a movie-making break.\n\nAsked about whether Oliver is a candidate, Herzog’s reply was succinct.\n\n‘‘John Oliver’s got a job,’’ he said.\n\nAsked if that meant he was not under consideration, Herzog said: ‘‘I think he’s spoken for.’’\n\nWhoever is chosen has heavy lifting to do.\n\n‘‘It’s almost impossible to estimate the impact that Jon Stewart has had on correcting misinformation in the media and calling out our politicians when they need to be called out,’’ said Sophia McClennen, a Penn State professor and author of ‘‘Is Satire Saving Our Nation?: Mockery and American Politics.’’\n\nAnd that was felt in the halls of power.\n\nStewart had a ‘‘very special talent for putting fear in everybody from the candidate to the operative to the intern, should they do something wrong, say something wrong. You knew it might be immortalized on ‘The Daily Show,’’’ said Kevin Madden, who was a campaign adviser for Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012.\n\nEven former President Bill Clinton felt compelled to weigh in, although lightheartedly.\n\n‘‘Jon Stewart’s departure raises 2 Qs: 1) Where will I get my news each night? 2) Does this mean he’s doing a sequel to Death to Smoochy?’’ Clinton posted on Twitter, including a reference to a 2002 comedy in which Stewart appeared.\n\nCandidates may still count on a post-Stewart ‘‘Daily Show’’ appearance, hoping to reach its young adult viewers and the potential votes they represent, said Rich Galen, a Republican consultant who worked on former Sen. Fred Thompson’s presidential campaign.\n\nThat could become a closed avenue, depending on what changes come to the show.\n\n‘‘But it won’t alter anyone’s campaign plans. It does take away one option that everybody had,’’ Galen said.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the show’s satiric viewpoint will be lost to TV or absent from the 2016 presidential election, others said.\n\n‘‘John Oliver has done incredible job on his (HBO) show, digging even deeper into issues’’ than Stewart has time to do on his show,’’ said Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama. Wilmore is also effective, and Stephen Colbert undoubtedly will continue to satirize politics and media’s coverage of it when he starts in late-night on CBS, he said.\n\nWhen it comes to satire, Favreau said, ‘‘there’s a demand for it out there.’’\n\n‘‘News satire will live on, largely because Stewart created an incredible market for it. In that sense, there will be a lot of folks trying to occupy the very big shadow he’s cast over the genre,’’ he said.\n\nHerzog expressed measured optimism that ‘‘The Daily Show’’ and its ‘‘Indecision’’ campaign watch — a part of Comedy Central well before Stewart joined — will remain factors in the presidential election next year.\n\n‘‘Why not? But who knows. Jon carved out a very particular place for himself within that dialogue. We’ll see what the next person brings,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s going to happen in a different way, in a different fashion, from a different point of view. But I’m pretty certain it’s going to happen.’’\n\n• Joanna Weiss: The snide world that Jon Stewart unwittingly spawned\n\n• Memorable ‘Daily Show’ moments with Jon Stewart\n\n• Jon Stewart to depart ‘The Daily Show’ later this year\n\n• Critic’s notebook: Jon Stewart shaped cultural attitudes of a generation\n\n• Video: Jon Stewart announces he’s leaving ‘The Daily Show’\n\n• Meta Wagner: Jon Stewart to leave ‘The Daily Show’?

        "instruction": "WESTBROOK THE dismissal last month a junior high school principal here has prompted a statewide organization of secondary school principals to help a local group of parents and teachers raise money for the ousted principal's effort to win reinstatement.\n\nRonald J. Studzinski, for seven years principal of Westbrook Junior High School, was dismissed by the Board of Education Sept. 21 on grounds of incompetence and inefficiency. The charges were based on the finding by an arbitration panel that Mr. Studzinski had failed to provide written teacher-evaluation reports. But in voting for the dismissal, the school board rejeceted the panel's recommendation that Mr. Studzinski be reprimanded and placed on probation until April.\n\nThe dismissal has been criticized by parents and teachers in part because of Mr. Studzinski's popularity among colleagues and students and also because the board's decision not to follow the recommendations of the panel was viewed generally as a threat to a principal's job security.\n\n''In view of what happened to Ron, if I were a principal anywhere in the state, I would be concerned about my job,'' said Peter M. D'Errico, a teacher at Westbrook High School and a member of the Ronald J. Studzinski Defense Fund Committee.\n\nNicholas R. Salvatore, chairman of the Status and Welfare Board, an affiliate of the Connecticut Association of Secondary School Principals, said his group had sent out letters to about 700 secondary schools asking that principals and other administrators contribute from $10 to $25.\n\n''This marks the first time that an arbitration panel's recommendations have been turned down by a school board, and the case has serious implications for school administrators throughout the state,'' said Mr. Salvatore, who is the principal of Canton High School.\n\nVictor Ferry, president of the Elementary and Middle School Principals Association of Connecticut, which represents about 800 principals and other administrators, said his group was considering similar action.\n\nEvelyn Smith, a member of the fund-raising committee in Westbrook, declined to say how much money had been raised to date. ''But we've been extremely gratified at the contributions we've been receiving, which have ranged from $10 to $1,000,'' she said.\n\nMr. Studzinski filed suit in Middlesex County Superior Court three weeks ago, asking the court to order the school board to reinstate him. His lawyer, Richard Hershatter of New Haven, said that the dismissal violated the State Teacher Tenure Act because the recommendations of the panel had not been followed.\n\nThe panel, under terms of the Teacher Tenure Act, consisted of one member appointed by the board, one by Mr. Studzinski and a third member chosen jointly by the board and the principal. It found after 23 hours of testimony that the Mr. Studzinski's failure to produce written teacher evaluations constituted incompetence but not of a degree warranting dismissal.\n\nThe school board's vote was 5 to 2 in favor of dismissal. ''What happens if at the end of the probation period we feel he is still incompetent?'' Michael Dore, a board member, said at the Sept. 21 hearing attended by more than 200 school personnel and town residents. ''Do we go back to a panel again and have another circus next summer? Over my dead body.''\n\nAnother board member, Eileen Daily, said in an interview that the board was not obliged to accept the panel's recommendations. ''We only had to accept the finding of facts - in this case incompetence, which was proven,'' she said.\n\nMr. Hershatter said, ''The level of inefficiency alleged did not rise to the statutory level that would have warranted dismissal.'' He agreed that the panel's recommendations were advisory and not binding, but, he said, ''at the same time the board can't just fly in the face of those recommendations.''\n\nAs to Mr. Studzinski's failure to provide written teacher evaluations, Mr. Hershatter said: ''In fact, nobody ever told him he had to do so. And he did provide written summaries, which served the same purpose.''\n\nMr. Hershatter said Mr. Studzinski had been asked to resign by Superintendent of Schools Robert Schreck last December but declined to do so. In April, the school board informed Mr. Studzinski that it was considering dismissing him. Shortly thereafter, the three-member panel was appointed.",

To lend collectors a technician's knowledge in laymen's language, the Indianapolis Museum of Art has just published the third edition of ''Consideration for the Care of Textiles and Costumes: A Handbook for the Non-Specialist,'' by Harold F.

In fact, 300 people, from a New York fabric conservator to a Los Angeles curator, joined a waiting list after the previous edition sold out a year ago.\n\n''Wash hands before handling textiles,'' is the first tip on a list of 10 do's and don'ts. The concise chapters that follow deal with climate control, lighting, cleaning, mildew, insect and rodent damage, mounting and exhibition.\n\n''Many people do have a collection of quilts, coverlets, christening dresses, samplers, antique full costume or partial costumes, paisley shawls or lace,'' Mr. Mailand said.\n\nAmong his words of caution in the book are: ''Historic textiles should never be pressed with a hot iron. Never exhibit textiles in direct sunlight. Never store costumes in plastic bags of any kind and keep in mind the disadvantages of pinning textiles.''\n\n''It is up to the imagination of individuals to gear the general information to their specific needs,'' he said. For those who cannot find material like UF-3 Plexiglas to keep ultraviolet rays out of exhibition rooms or acid-free paper to keep chemical breakdown at a minimum in a storage space, Mr. Mailand suggested some suppliers at the end of the book as well as a bibliography for further reading.\n\n''This is the first publication that puts all aspects of maintenance into one reference,'' he said. He referred to textiles as once being the ''ugly stepchildren of most collections.''\n\nThe handbook is available for $4 in the book department of the Alliance Museum Shop at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, or by mail for $4.75.

Frederick Grimes, the organist, who will conduct the orchestra, soloists and choir, will also perform the Prelude and Fugue in D, BWV 532. The series continues steadily through Feb. 21 and recesses through Lent until April 4. There is no admission charge, but offerings are accepted. JAZZ\n\nNew York is home to so many jazz musicians that even if relatively few can make a full-time living out of their art, they form a community as cohesive and mutually self-concerned as any other in town. When Monty Waters, an alto-saxophone player, was faced with the necessity of having an extensive hip operation, his fellow musicians decided to help raise funds to help. A benefit will take place tomorrow from 3 to 8 P.M. at the Jazz Forum, on the fifth floor of 648 Broadway, near Bleecker Street.\n\nMore than 60 jazzmen will perform during the five-hour set, among them Art Blakey Jr., Hamiet Bluiett, Clifford Jordan, Joe Newman and Charlie Rouse.

He was 52 years old.\n\nHe had collaborated with his partner, William Link, for nearly four decades, since they wrote plays in junior high school. Among the team's creations were such hit series as ''Murder, She Wrote'' and ''Columbo,'' and dozens of films and television movies, including ''That Certain Summer,'' ''The Execution of Private Slovik'' and ''My Sweet Charlie,'' for which they won an Emmy Award.\n\nThe team won a reputation for quality and originality in a field where critics use such words sparingly. Peter S. Fischer, who created ''Murder, She Wrote'' with Mr. Levinson and Mr. Link, said of Mr. Levinson, ''He felt if it was worth doing it was worth doing well.''\n\nHis 38-year collaboration with Mr. Link was a rarity in Hollywood, where partnerships do not last long. Asked in 1985 whether true art can be a collaboration, he said: ''To me the novel is the highest form of art. No two people can write a great novel. But in a medium of popular entertainment, when you're collaborating with actors, directors and everyone else anyway, I see nothing wrong with a writing team.\n\n''Bill and I have no pretensions to be artists,'' he said. ''We are not Gunter Grass or Vladimir Nabokov. What we try to do is the highest quality popular entertainment we can do, with an occasional thought sticking through.'' Partners in Junior High School\n\nThe collaboration and the friendship of Mr. Levinson and Mr. Link began in 1946 in junior high school in suburban Philadelphia, where they created radio scripts. At the University of Pennsylvania, the team wrote film criticism for the college newspaper and had several short stories published in Playboy magazine.\n\nTheir first work in ''the big time,'' Mr. Link said, came in 1959 when their play ''Chain of Command,'' an Army drama, was performed by the Desilu Playhouse. Over the next few years they wrote for such programs as ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ''Dr. Kildare'' and ''The Fugitive.'' They created their first television series, ''Mannix,'' in 1968. In 1969, they created ''Columbo,'' for which the team won an Emmy, and in 1975 they created ''Ellery Queen.''\n\nThe penchant toward mystery writing earned them four Edgar Awards -a record number - from the Mystery Writers of America for contributions to the writing of mystery stories in television series. When not working on television series they were writing stage plays, including the Broadway show ''Merlin,'' a showcase for the magic tricks of Doug Henning, and television movies. ''That Certain Summer,'' which was broadcast in 1972, was one of the first television films about a homosexual relationship. ''My Sweet Charlie'' was the story of an interracial friendship, and ''The Execution of Private Slovik'' was based on a controversial military trial. Touched 'Emotional' Chord\n\n''His real love was the TV movie,'' Mr. Link said of his partner. ''Each time out we tried to do something that hadn't been seen before, something that would touch an emotional or social chord.''\n\nTheir most recent collaboration, however, was another mystery series, ''Murder, She Wrote,'' which Mr. Levinson described more than a year ago as riding the wave of renewed interest in mysteries. ''It is definitely a time for mysteries again,'' he said. ''There is a theory that during a time of chaos, the orderly procedures of the classic mystery have renewed appeal. I'm not sure I subscribe to that theory. I just think the form has a lot of juice to it. People keep rediscovering it.\n\n''Car chases are becoming too expensive to film,'' he said. ''On shows like ''Murder, She Wrote'' most of the scenes are just two or three people in a room talking.''\n\nMr. Levinson is survived by his father, William; his wife, Rosanna, an actress, and a daughter, Christine, both of Los Angeles.",

        "instruction": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Billington frequently reports on the cultural scene in London. By MICHAEL BILLINGTON LONDON At a time when the debate on nuclear arms control is beginning to dominate both public platforms and private lives (more than 40 new books on nuclear issues are being published in the United States this year), it seems appropriate to have a television series about the responsibility of the scientist toward society. And that is precisely the moral territory occupied by ''Oppenheimer,'' a sevenpart dramatized biography of the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer; it stars Sam Waterston as ''the father of the atomic bomb.'' (The initial one-hour installment will be shown Tuesday at 9 P.M. on Channel 13, as part of the weekly ''American Playhouse'' series.)\n\nIf, as Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, recently suggested, nuclear disarmament is the central moral issue of the 1980's, then that largely stems from the activities of Oppenheimer and his scientific colleagues in the United States in the 1940's.\n\nOppenheimer's own story is a tragic one. The son of a New York businessman, he was a supremely gifted and popular professor of physics at Berkeley in the 1930's. In 1943, he became director at Los Alamos of the atom bomb design section of the Manhattan Project. As such, he was responsible for the first testing of the bomb in July 1945 and deeply involved in President Truman's decision to use it at Hiroshima a month later.\n\nBut after the war, as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission's General Advisory Committee, Oppenheimer came to believe that nuclear re-armament must be accompanied by greater public information and a system of international control. Then in 1954 his past Communist affiliations were dragged out of the cupboard and, at a hearing before the commission's Personnel Security Board, his security clearance was refused. He was discredited and, although subsequently honored by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, he died in 1967 pretty much a broken man.\n\nA dramatic story. And one masterminded for television by producer Peter Goodchild of the British Broadcasting Corporation's Science Department. (''Oppenheimer'' is a a co-production between the BBC and Boston's public-service station WGBH, which put up 15 percent of the project's $1.5 million costs.) Mr. Goodchild conceived the idea as long ago as 1975 when he produced for the department's Special Features Unit a dramatized series on the life of Marie Curie, which starred Jane Lapotaire.\n\n''That production made me feel,'' he says, ''that we should follow the history of radioactivity right the way through. But having read Robert Jungk's book, 'Brighter Than a Thousand Suns,' which deals with the genesis of the Manhattan Project and the dropping of the first atom bomb, I decided we should go to the other end of the spectrum and tackle the Oppenheimer story. It is, after all, the ultimate account of the scientist dealing with matters of private conscience and public morality.''\n\nBut given the raw material is so rich, what have Mr. Goodchild and the writer of the series, the novelist and playwright Peter Prince, done with it? Have they, for instance, followed the line of German dramatist Heinar Kipphardt who in a 1964 play about the security hearings showed Oppenheimer as a scientist who sacrificed the good of humanity to the interests of an irresponsible state?\n\n''In the first place,'' says Mr. Goodchild, ''we are trying to tell the story. Eighty percent of the material we use is verifiable. Only 20 percent is invented or condensed simply to keep the story moving on. But my own feeling about the Manhattan Project is that one is dealing with people whose overriding concern was with building the bomb. Everyone was too caught up in the technology of the thing to be arguing hourly about the morality. The issues were felt but not faced. Oppenheimer himself came to believe that there had to be a system of international control of atomic weapons. He really believed he could influence things through the political system. But his tragedy was that he was shadowed by his left-wing past.\n\n''If there is a governing idea running through the series,'' adds Mr. Goodchild, ''it is that Oppenheimer is not a moral totem pole, that he is too complex and elusive to be used to prove any one point. It struck us that Oppenheimer was a great role-player and many different things during his life - something symbolized by his hair. When he was a radical professor at Berkeley - a figure with intellectual sex-appeal - he had a shock of curly hair. When he became a political executive, his hair was cropped close. For the hearings, he was gaunt and thin with his iron-gray hair close to the skull. In each phase of his life, he adopts a new appearance. Essentially, we see him as a man who tried to operate within a political system. In the end, that system catches up with him and brings about his downfall.''",

        "output": "--------------------------------------------------------------------  Michael Billington frequently reports on the cultural scene in London. By MICHAEL BILLINGTON LONDON At a time when the debate on nuclear arms control is beginning to dominate both public platforms and private lives (more than 40 new books on nuclear issues are being published in the United States this year), it seems appropriate to have a television series about the responsibility of the scientist toward society. And that is precisely the moral territory occupied by ''Oppenheimer,'' a sevenpart dramatized biography of the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer; it stars Sam Waterston as ''the father of the atomic bomb.'' (The initial one-hour installment will be shown Tuesday at 9 P.M. on Channel 13, as part of the weekly ''American Playhouse'' series.)   If, as Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, recently suggested, nuclear disarmament is the central moral issue of the 1980's, then that largely stems from the activities of Oppenheimer and his scientific colleagues in the United States in the 1940's."

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON — The rash of attacks against Target and other top retailers is likely to be the leading edge of a wave of serious cybercrime, as hackers become increasingly skilled at breaching the nation’s antiquated payment systems, experts say.\n\nTraditional defenses, such as installing antivirus software and monitoring accounts for unusual activity, have offered little resistance against Eastern European criminal gangs whose programmers write malicious code aimed at specific companies or buy inexpensive hacking kits online. Armed with such tools, criminals can check for system weaknesses in wireless networks, computer servers, or stores’ card readers.\n\nNearly two dozen companies have been hacked in cases similar to the Target breach and more almost certainly will fall victim in the months ahead, the FBI recently warned retailers, according to an official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The names of all of the compromised firms have not been revealed, nor is it clear how many shoppers have had their credit card numbers and other personal data stolen.\n\nBanks, retailers, and policy makers have been slow to address the growing sophistication of cybercriminals. Only 11 percent of businesses have adopted industry-standard security measures, said a recent report by Verizon Business Solutions, and outside experts say even these ‘‘best practices’’ fall short of what is needed to defeat aggressive hackers lured by the prospect of a multimillion-dollar heist.\n\n‘‘You’re going to see more and more people trying this,’’ said Nicolas Christin, a security researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. ‘‘If you just saw your neighbor win the lottery, even if you weren’t interested in the lottery before, you may go out and buy a ticket.’’\n\nCybercrime cost US companies an average of $11.5 million in 2012, according to a study by the Ponemon Institute, up 26 percent compared with the previous year. The effect on consumers can last for years, as they are left vulnerable to bogus charges and potential identity theft.\n\nExperts say that reversing the rise in major data breaches would require expensive upgrades, including the adoption of end-to-end encryption, the walling-off of the most sensitive data on separate networks, and the adoption of newer credit card technology that holds customer information on an embedded chip rather than the familiar black magnetic strip on most American cards.\n\nCredit card chips can communicate with banks in a way that better protects a user’s private information, often requiring a personal identification number to verify a purchase. Such systems are widespread in most of the developed world but are appearing in the United States only gradually.\n\n‘‘Our decades-old payment system was not designed with cybersecurity in mind,’’ said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. ‘‘Times have changed. Data breaches now occur on a weekly basis, the result of which is that consumers become victims of fraud and identity theft.’’\n\nAn industry group including the major American credit card issuers is pushing for widespread adoption of chip cards by October 2015. Consumer groups want Washington to mandate a faster and more complete shift, but federal regulators have balked at forcing the politically influential banking industry to invest in new technology, especially if there is a chance that it might not thwart future attacks.\n\nIn a sign of the growing concern over credit card security, Congress held four hearings last week to examine whether the industry and the government are doing enough to protect consumers. Tuesday’s meeting featured officials from the largest retailers at the center of the recent run of data breaches.\n\n‘‘The unfortunate reality is that we suffered a breach, and all businesses — and their customers — are facing increasingly sophisticated threats from cybercriminals,’’ John Mulligan, Target’s chief financial officer, told lawmakers.\n\nHackers lifted 40 million debit and credit card numbers from Target customers during the holiday season. The company later said thieves also grabbed personal information, including names, home addresses, and telephone numbers, of an additional 70 million customers in that attack. Other companies have since reported breaches of their computer systems.\n\n‘‘I think we’re going to hear a lot about these breaches over the next year,’’ said Brian Krebs, a cybersecurity journalist who blogs at KrebsOnSecurity.com. ‘‘It just looks like some of the guys involved in this activity have compromised a ridiculous number of companies.’’\n\nKrebs reported that the Target breach happened after criminals gained access to the company networks through a contractor that was servicing heating and air-conditioning systems at several stores.\n\nDepartment store Neiman Marcus also was attacked recently. Its senior vice president, Michael Kingston, told lawmakers Tuesday that the company’s antivirus software was virtually useless in defending its computers. The retailer did not detect that its credit card systems were being hacked, and the company did not learn of the intrusion until the beginning of January, many months after it began.\n\nHis reference to antivirus software drew scoffs from security experts, who compare the protections offered by such programs to a flu shot — capable of staving off infection from wide and unfocused threats but of little value against a serious attacker determined to breach a specific network.\n\nSecurity experts say companies must install systems that detect and halt intrusions quickly, before massive amounts of personal data can be lost.\n\n‘‘Companies need to be hunting on their networks constantly . . . looking for signs of compromise,’’ said Shawn Henry, former head of cybercrime for the FBI and now president of Crowdstrike Services, a security company.",

        "instruction": "At bus stops and subway stations in inner cities around the country, a well-dressed black trumpeter grins from a Benson & Hedges billboard and says his brand of cigarettes is ''for people who like to smoke.''\n\nPerched on roofs of dilapidated stores, a popular black movie star -his arm around a beautiful woman -promises that Colt 45 malt liquor ''works every time.''\n\nFaced with declining or slowing consumption, the alcohol and tobacco industries have been concentrating their billboard advertising in poorer urban neighborhoods, many of them largely black. Now health officials, city leaders, members of Congress, neighborhood groups and consumer advocates are objecting, concerned that people in those neighborhoods are dying in disproportionate numbers from diseases related to smoking and drinking. The Wrong Message, Critics Say\n\n''Every day when little children are on their way to school they get a message that the way to be happy and get ahead is to have a beer and smoke cigarettes,'' said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. Mr. Lewis hopes to introduce national legislation aimed at encouraging cities to replace alcohol and cigarette ads with public health messages on billboards.\n\n''This marketing strategy is outrageous and immoral,'' said Harold P. Freeman, director of surgery of Harlem Hospital and national president of the American Cancer Society. ''The cigarette industry just wants to make money because they know that poor and uneducated people are their main customers. And black people are disproportionately poor and uneducated.''\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, 40.6 percent of black men older than 20 smoke, compared with 31.8 percent of white men; 31.8 percent of black women smoke, compared with 28.3 percent of white women. Tobacco Industry's Defense\n\nSteve Weiss, manager of media relations at the Philip Morris Companies, said a public outcry over industry advertising in minority neighborhoods is unfair.\n\n''We advertise our cigarettes to anyone who smokes, regardless of their race or background,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''Adults who smoke in this country are making an informed choice. The argument that minorities are more susceptible to our advertising is at best reprehensible and at worst racist.''\n\nNationwide billboard surveys show a wide disparity in the amount of tobacco and alcohol advertising in black and white communities.\n\nFor example, a 1987 survey by the City of St. Louis found nearly three times as many billboards in black neighborhoods as in white ones. Of those, 62 percent advertised cigarettes and alcohol, compared with 36 percent in white neighborhoods. The survey prompted the City Council to prohibit new billboards.\n\nEarlier this year, a survey by The Detroit Free Press found that advertisements for cigarettes and alcohol accounted for nearly 43 percent of Detroit's 900 inner-city billboards. Of 93 billboards just beyond the city's borders, 24.7 percent carried such ads. Other city surveys produced similar results.\n\n''These ads tell us that everything is O.K. in billboard heaven, but down below the people are dying,'' said Alberta Tinsley-Williams, a Wayne County commissioner from Detroit who in March introduced legislation for a citywide ban on new billboards.\n\nAdvertisers say the marketing strategy makes good business sense. ''It is logical to target black neighborhoods with these ads, since blacks have higher consumption indices for these products,'' said Bill Sharp, senior vice president and general manager of Burrell Advertising, a black-owned Chicago company.\n\nIn the United States as a whole, consumption of tobacco, liquor and wine has been decreasing. Impact magazine, a trade publication for the alcoholic beverage industry, reported that consumption of liquor and wine had declined 9 percent from 1980 to 1987, to 847 million gallons from 931 million.\n\nCigarette consumption declined 11 percent between 1980 and 1988, to 562.5 billion cigarettes from 631.5 billion, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut health problems that can be linked to smoking and alcohol are still a major public concern. A 1987 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based health advocacy group, found that black men have a 70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of the liver than whites.\n\nMoreover, the lung cancer rate among blacks has increased four times faster than among whites in the last 30 years, according to statistics from the American Lung Association and the National Cancer Institute. Leading Outdoor Advertisers\n\nAndrea MacDonald, director of marketing services for the Institute of Outdoor Advertising, a Manhattan-based trade association, said tobacco is the nation's top advertiser in outdoor media. Ms. MacDonald said the alcohol and tobacco industries combined accounted for 33.2 percent of outdoor advertising contracts in 1988, paying $471.5 million.\n\nAlthough the debate centers largely on health problems, many city leaders complain that such advertising is an urban blight as well. ''We find more alcohol and cigarette billboards than trees in some of our neighborhoods,'' said Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat.\n\nSince 1986 more than 500 cities have enacted regulations to control the proliferation of billboards.\n\nOfficials in Baltimore are trying to offset the high concentration of cigarette and alcohol advertising by buying up billboards to provide public service messages. ''We think the way to approach this is to send healthy messages about the body and mind, to raise the community's collective conscience,'' Mayor Kurt Schmoke said.\n\nPhoto of a cigaretee ad in Detroit advertising Virginia Slims (NYT/Peter Yates)",

        "instruction": "Mike Nichols is talking about ''Waiting for Godot'':\n\n''This is one of the few plays, if not the only play, of which you can say, 'It's about everything.' It's about our lives. It's about devices people use to get through their lives. There's nothing that happens in 'Godot' that hasn't happened to everyone in one form or another: forgetting, not being able to remember exactly where you were last Tuesday, starting to say, 'Remember, we worked for that man, I forget his name, he lives in that place, for the moment I forget the name.' It happens to me every other day. It's about being bored by other people's pretensions. Everything is very specific. It's about daily life.''\n\nMr. Nichols's production of the classic Samuel Beckett drama, which he is also directing and which stars F. Murray Abraham, Bill Irwin, Steve Martin and Robin Williams, is scheduled to begin performances Oct. 11 for a seven-week run at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater under the auspices of Lincoln Center Theater. Tickets, at least at this point, are to be offered only to theater members.\n\nThe director and the cast took time out from their second day of rehearsals to talk about the play as well as their problems, their excitement and the fears and challenges of putting together such an eagerly awaited production.\n\nMr. Martin and Mr. Williams are, respectively, Vladimir (Didi) and Estragon (Gogo), the two characters who are waiting for Godot. Mr. Abraham is Pozzo, who suddenly arrives with his servant, Lucky (Mr. Irwin).\n\n''I've wanted to do 'Godot' since I first read it, in the 50's, when it was first published in the Grove Press edition,'' Mr. Nichols says. ''I was also in the play, in Chicago, with Harvey Korman. I played Lucky.''\n\n''Then, about four or five years ago, Steve and I first started talking about it. I thought Didi would be a great part for him. And we kept coming back to it. We've been friends for quite a long time, and every few months one of us would say, 'Well, what about Godot?' and we talked to Robin, and he was interested, and then I talked to Gregory Mosher, because at that point he was just taking over as director of Lincoln Center Theater, and I wanted to do it in an institutional way, as part of a theater.\n\n''A year ago July, we all got together at Steve's house in California. By then I had thought of Murray and Bill. And we sat at Steve's and read it and decided to do it.'' Doing It Beckett's Way\n\nAbout six months ago, Mr. Nichols says, he went to France to discuss the play with Mr. Beckett. ''We talked about a lot of things,'' he says. ''I asked him at one point what one of the tunes was to one of the little songs in the play, and he sang it for me and cracked himself up.''\n\nMr. Nichols says he will be faithful to Beckett - ''We'll do it all Sam's way.''\n\nThe play is billed as a tragicomedy, and Mr. Nichols feels it is equally tragic and comic. ''I haven't seen a lot of Beckett,'' he says. ''But I saw Billie Whitelaw do 'Rockaby,' and the Beckett experience is that when the play is over, you sit there and you're utterly depressed because there seems to be no hope at all. And then you walk 15 blocks, and you feel good, and finally you feel great, because somebody has told the truth, and the truth in the end is the best thing we have. After you forget the initial depression, it can uplift you and make you feel actually joyous.''\n\nThe comedy in the play is one reason for the joy, Mr. Abraham feels.\n\n''When Mike called me, he asked, 'What do you think about doing Godot,' and my immediate response was, 'Which part?' And he said, 'The best part in the show,' and I said, 'Who's doing the other two parts?' because I knew instantly he wasn't offering me Didi or Gogo. And he said, 'No, really, it's the best,' and I said, 'I know Pozzo is a fabulous part, but who's doing Didi and Gogo?' because if you ain't got those two you ain't got nothing. And when he told me, I said, 'I'm ready to do it right now.' ''\n\n''And what I thought about after the phone call,'' Mr. Abraham says, ''was that I think this production is going to redefine this play in American terms. Because Europeans - particularly the French - have a very different idea of what this play means to them. It's much more informal, much more intimate, much more personal, much freer and much more fun.\n\n''I see it as being absolutely funny, and enjoyable, and a pleasure, with of course tragic overtones. People say, 'We're going to see ''Godot'' because it's what we have to do,' but maybe now they're going to do it because it's a wonderful, happy thing to do.''\n\nMr. Irwin agrees. ''We don't want this to be a piece of arch art,'' he says. ''This play is supposed to quintessentially represent existentialism. Today, as an exercise, Mike had each of us read someone else's part, and when I found myself reading Steve's part, I suddenly heard this sort of existential voice coming out of my mouth. And when you hear that you always want to leave the room as quickly as possible.''\n\n''But it's really such a funny clown piece,'' he says. ''At least in one's mind's eye - we've yet to see what kind of a play we'll do. But when you read it, it's such a funny, physical, visceral piece. The stage directions are all about things like they jump upon him, they restrain him physically, they pull him to the ground. But at the same time it sort of resonates historically and theologically in a way which as you get older you start to find is more pertinent to your life. I don't mean in the sense of religion, but in the sense of questions about life. Like Shakespeare says, it holds the mirror sort of disturbingly up to nature.''\n\nMr. Martin also finds the play's humor essential. ''It's everything I like in a comedy,'' he says. ''Funny and sad.''\n\n''When I first reread it, I said: 'This is funny, and its more serious meaning seems to take care of itself. You don't have to act serious and you don't have to act dramatic for its meaning to be conveyed. As Mike keeps saying, 'We just don't want you to think, 'Uh-oh, it's art.' '' A Risk in Doing This\n\n''Godot'' is Mr. Martin's first theatrical appearance in 25 years, since he appeared in a play at Knott's Berry Farm (he has, of course, done his comedy act on stage for most of those years). And, he acknowledges that there's a risk in doing this play.\n\n''If it fails, it's a memorable one,'' he says. ''So your whole life will be dogged with this failure.''\n\nMr. Williams, who is making his professional stage debut - although he too has done his comedy act for years - is also aware of the risk. But it doesn't bother him, he says, and he says it in his typical Robin Williams way.\n\n''Risk!'' he exclaims in mock despair. ''Of never working on the stage again! Oh, no! You're ruined! It's like you're ruined socially in Tustin'' - a small town in California. ''Oh, no! You'll never be allowed back there again!''\n\nBut then he gets serious. ''If there's risk, you can't think about it,'' he says. ''Or you'll never be able to do the play.''\n\nMr. Williams is well known for his ad libbing, for his improvisation. But, he says, this is one case where he'll hold himself in check. ''You can do physical things,'' he says, ''but you don't ad lib Beckett. Just like you don't riff Beethoven.''\n\nDoing the play is ''interesting and terrifying at the same time,'' he says. ''It's an ensemble piece, and you really have to put your faith in other people, and in yourself too - you have to be there for them. It's the type of piece where you can't let up. If you slack off for a second, it goes. One word is gone and - scrunch! - the whole thing is like a quarter on the Japanese Osaka railroad track!''\n\n''It's hard to describe,'' he says. ''There'll be moments you'll get a spark of it, a gleam of light, and then boom! You're gone. It seems easy, then it goes away, then it gets so incredibly hard.'' He pauses. ''It's like having sex in a wind tunnel.'' He pauses again. ''Or it's like water skiing in quicksand.'' And again. ''Or putting together a jigsaw puzzle in a hurricane.\n\n''I heard that when Bert Lahr was doing Estragon'' - Lahr starred in the first American production, in 1956 - ''they asked him, 'What are you doing in this play?' And he said, 'I don't know.' And then I heard that Beckett was real happy with that.''\n\nphoto of Mike Nichols, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Bill Irwin and F. Murray Abraham (NYT/Fred R. Conrad)",

        "instruction": "SECRETARY OF EDUCATION T.H. Bell is planning to establish a national commission on excellence in education to reverse what he describes as a ''nationwide problem of declining college entrance scores'' and to assure high standards of achievement. He also plans to urge tougher requirements for promotion from grade to grade and for graduation from high school.\n\nWhile reaffirming the Reagan Administration's view that education is a state and local responsibility, Mr. Bell has written that he is also aware that the Federal Government ''can play a useful coordination and advocacy role.'' He adds that he is convinced the''success of this endeavor will not require the continued existence of the Department of Education, and the plans for dismantling of the department will go forward.''\n\nThe plans are described by Mr. Bell in a four-page memorandum, dated last July 6, to Craig L. Fuller, director of the Office of Cabinet Administration. The purpose of the memorandum, Mr. Bell wrote, is ''to communicate to my colleagues in the White House and the Cabinet'' specific steps to ''call attention to an alarmingly persistent decline in quality education.''\n\nDepartment executives who asked not to be named said last week that an early announcement was planned. The commission, whose membership is undetermined, is expected to represent business, school and college administrators, school boards and parents. It will be given 18 months to make its recommendations.\n\nMr. Bell wrote that the commission would not ask for increased Federal expenditures or an expanded Federal role in education. He sees the promise of reduced Federal rules and paperwork as ''one means of enhancing quality in our schools.''\n\nMr. Bell's proposal emphasizes that the ensuing report will not be directed to him but ''to the American academic community, to governing boards, to state legislative bodies and to others responsible for general control, support and supervision of schools and colleges.''\n\nThe hortatory approach is reminiscent of a Federal effort in 1961 by Dr. Sterling M. McMurrin, then United States Commissioner of Education, who said he intended to make his office ''a national forum'' of ideas from academic and nonacademic sources. But large infusions of Federal money did not materialize until 1965, in the Johnson Administration under Francis Keppel, Mr. McMurrin's successor, and the forum-of-ideas concept appears to have had little effect.\n\nMr. Bell's plan differs from that earlier version in that it is more specific. According to his memorandum, he intends to assign to the commission certain detailed tasks, including a review of the data and literature on the quality of learning and teaching in schools, colleges and universities, public as well as private. Other tasks would include a comparison of American curriculums, standards and expectations with those in the educational systems of several other advanced countries, and a study of college admissions standards and course requirements, to determine their effect on the requirements exacted of students in high schools.\n\nThe commission will also be asked to review and describe programs that help students to succeed both in college entrance examinations and in their first two years in college. It will study ''the major changes that have occurred in American education as well as events in society during the past quarter century that have significantly affected educational achievement,'' and it will hold regional hearings and solicit expert advice on how to improve the quality of education.\n\nMr. Bell's emphasis is on ''persuasion.'' He promises a vigorous effort ''over the next few months'' to persuade the schools to be guided by practices that have been shown to be effective, and he points to five factors that the National Institute of Education, the department's research arm, has already identified. A spokesman for the institute listed these factors:\n\n- Strong administrative leadership, especially by the principal.\n\n- A school climate conducive to learning, including the absence of disruption, violence and fear.\n\n- Schoolwide emphasis on the basic skills of reading, writing and computation.\n\n- Expectation by teachers that all students, regardless of background, be able to learn.\n\n- An effective system of monitoring students' achievement and keeping them informed about how well they are doing. Mr. Bell's memorandum added: ''Through the work of the National Commission on Excellence, we will identify and highlight those schools that are producing graduates who consistently attain high scores in college entrance examinations.'' He also expects the panel to cite those colleges that have served the goals of excellence by working with high schools and maintaining high admission standards.\n\n''By recognizing the best models, we hope to make the examples contagious,'' Mr. Bell wrote. He promised a ''drive to persuade school boards and state education agencies to adopt policies that will raise the levels of expected achievement'' and to ''hold in high esteem the attainment of the highest order of literacy and academic competence.''\n\nThe memorandum also seeks ''to encourage, through changes in state and local standards, greater emphasis on writing with clarity and profoundness, mastery of mathematics, spelling, basic science, economics and principles of government in a democracy.'' It further ''hopes to persuade'' schools to ''refuse diplomas of graduation and promotions from one grade to another to those who do not meet acceptable standards of academic proficiency.''\n\nEducators may worry that the commission will go over too much familiar ground, already long on research but chronically short on action. For example, a past report, commissioned by the College Entrance Examination Board, has analyzed the causes of the decline in scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test over the last 18 years. The Swedish education expert Torsten Husen has amassed exhaustive data on the academic achievements of children in 22 countries, including the United States.\n\nAlthough the memorandum insists that the proposed action will ''fully support'' the Reagan Administration's so-called New Federalism, in which it seeks to keep the Government from interfering in what it regards as functions of state and local governments, some critics may question that assertion. For example, some may regard such specific policy guidelines as tough requirements for school promotions and college admissions as a subtle form of Federal intrusion into local, state or collegiate affairs.\n\nFinancially hard-pressed school districts may wish that Washington offered them more money and less persuasion and advocacy. Some critics may deplore the memorandum's preoccupation with college admission standards as the main indicator of educational quality, or the absence of interest in the education of the disadvantaged, the area that has been the focus of Federal concern for the past 15 years. Others may miss references to the economic barriers to college admission which in many cases may close the doors to higher education to academically qualified but needy young people.\n\nIllustrations: drawing of student in front of panel",

        "instruction": "Harold Nicholas, the younger member of the dazzling tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in New York City.\n\nThe cause was heart failure following surgery at New York Hospital, said Bruce Goldstein, a friend and a writer of the 1992 documentary ''Nicholas Brothers: We Sing and We Dance.''\n\nThe careers of Mr. Nicholas and his brother, Fayard, began in their childhood. Harold Nicholas continued to perform as a singer and raconteur into the 1990's as a guest artist with companies including Lynn Dally's Jazz Tap Ensemble, with which the brothers were to have appeared in a tribute this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThey danced in vaudeville, on Broadway, in nightclubs and on television. But it was their dancing in movie musicals that brought them the most acclaim and made them internationally famous.\n\nHarold Nicholas appeared in more than 50 films, from 1932 to 1989, including ''The Big Broadcast of 1936'' (1935), ''Down Argentine Way'' (1940), ''Tin Pan Alley'' (1940), ''Sun Valley Serenade'' (1941) and ''Stormy Weather'' (1943). The brothers' gifts were epitomized in ''Stormy Weather,'' an all-black 20th Century Fox musical, in which they seemed to explode on the screen in their trademark fast footwork and astonishing leaps and splits. Their ''Jumpin' Jive'' dance in that film, Fred Astaire told them, was the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen.\n\nIn that number the brothers danced on drums and leaped over the heads of orchestra musicians. ''Spins, cramp rolls, turns and crossover steps were woven into an intricate pattern of sound and movement, as the brothers spun out back-sliding rhythms that slipped smoothly from place to place on the stage,'' Constance Valis Hill wrote in her ''Brotherhood in Rhythm: The Jazz Tap Dancing of the Nicholas Brothers,'' published this year.\n\nThe brothers absorbed all that they saw in dance in films and on the stage, including work by Nick Castle, the 20th Century Fox choreographer, and George Balanchine, who cast the brothers in two Broadway musicals he choreographed, ''The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936'' and ''Babes in Arms'' (1937). The two also appeared on Broadway in ''St. Louis Woman'' (1946), in which Harold introduced the song ''Come Rain or Come Shine.''\n\nTheir tap was an extraordinarily fluent blend of jazz, tap, ''flash-act'' acrobatics, angular eccentric movement, black vernacular dance and ballet. They themselves called their work ''classical tap,'' not only because it incorporated elements of ballet but also because they danced with their whole bodies, including the often-neglected arms and hands. Fayard Nicholas, six years older than Harold and a lifetime mentor, choreographed their early dances, but Harold later came into his own as a more instinctual dance-maker.\n\nBorn in Winston-Salem, N.C., to Ulysses and Viola Nicholas, musicians and vaudeville orchestra directors, Harold Lloyd Nicholas began dancing at 5 at black vaudeville houses in Philadelphia as a member of the Nicholas Kids, a show-stopping act that Fayard had created for his brother, himself and their sister Dorothy. The brothers' formal professional debut was made in 1930 on the radio show ''Horn & Hardart Kiddie Hour.''\n\nWithin two years they were performing in New York City. At the Lafayette Theater in Harlem they were seen by a Warner Brothers producer who helped them land their first film roles, in a black vaudeville short called ''Pie, Pie, Blackbird'' (1932). They made their debut in 1932 at the Cotton Club. A formidable blend of innocence and sophistication, the Nicholas Brothers were born.\n\nTheir Hollywood career began after Samuel Goldwyn saw them at the club, where they performed as headliners for eight years, and cast them in ''Kid Millions'' (1934). A well-received stint in London followed in the stage revue ''Blackbirds of 1936.'' One reviewer noted of Harold, in The Times of London in 1936, that the audience did not know whether to admire most his ''twinkling feet or slow, baby smile.''\n\nThe brothers became grown-up stars in ''Down Argentine Way'' (1940) and appeared in five other films for 20th Century Fox. Despite racial restrictions -- no speaking parts, no scenes with their white co-stars and dances designed to be easily deleted by Southern exhibitors -- the two became huge film stars. Their last film together was ''The Pirate'' (1948), in which Gene Kelly broke the color bar by dancing with them.\n\nHarold Nicholas appeared as a solo artist in films including ''Uptown Saturday Night'' (1974), ''Tap'' (1989) and ''The Five Heartbeats'' (1991). He also had a successful career in France, where he moved in 1950, and performed as a dancer and singer throughout Europe and in North Africa. He appeared with Eddie Constantine in the French film ''L'Empire de la Nuit'' (1964).\n\nBack in the United States, Mr. Nicholas performed on television and on the road. He returned to Europe to perform in the 1980's, as popular as ever. Mr. Nicholas was a familiar presence on the New York dance scene for the last 20 years, as a wry commentator and a subtle sweet-voiced singer who executed a teasing step or two on occasion. With his brother, he was the subject of a 1998 tribute at Carnegie Hall. Other honors include the jointly received 1991 Kennedy Center honors, the 1998 Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award and an Academy Awards tribute in 1981. The brothers also taught as visiting dance artists at Harvard University and Radcliffe College in 1996.\n\nMr. Nicholas's marriages to the actress Dorothy Dandridge and Elyanne Patronne ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife Rigmor Newman Nicholas, of New York City; his brother, Fayard; his sister, Dorothy Morrow; a daughter, Harolyn; a son, Melih, all of Los Angeles; and two stepchildren, Frederick Newman of Torrington, Conn., and Annie, of Los Angeles.\n\nMr. Nicholas was always urbanely ready for anything. In a 1988 interview in The New York Times, the tap star, then 67, was asked if he would do his trademark move at a forthcoming show.\n\n''I'll do a split or two maybe,'' he said. ''Don't plural it too much.''\n\nPhoto: Exploding on the screen with leaps and flat-out splits: The Nicholas Brothers, Harold, left, and Fayard, in the 1941 film ''Sun Valley Serenade.''

In November 2014, the Omaha World-Herald published an extensive story about their claims and Saturday was the first to report the Marines were looking into the matter.\n\nAssociated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal shot the photo on Feb. 23, 1945, on Mount Suribachi, amid an intense battle with the Japanese. Rosenthal didn’t get the names of the men, but the photo immediately was celebrated in the US and President Franklin Roosevelt told the military to identify the men.\n\nAfter some confusion, the Marines identified the men as John Bradley, Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, Harlon Block, Michael Strank and Franklin Sousley. All were Marines except Bradley, who was a Navy corpsman.\n\nBlock, Strank and Sousley were killed in fighting at Iwo Jima before the photo was distributed in the US.\n\nOn Monday, the Marines issued a statement saying, “The Marine Corps is examining information provided by a private organization related (to) Joe Rosenthal’s Associated Press photograph of the second flag raising on Iwo Jima.\n\n“Rosenthal’s photo captured a single moment in the 36-day battle during which more than 6,500 US servicemen made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation and it is representative of the more than 70,000 US Marines, Sailors, Soldiers and Coast Guardsmen that took part in the battle. We are humbled by the service and sacrifice of all who fought on Iwo Jima.”\n\nIwo Jima, a tiny island 660 miles south of Tokyo, was the site of an intense 36-day battle that began Feb. 19, 1945, between about 70,000 Marines and 18,000 Japanese soldiers. Capturing Iwo Jima was deemed essential to the US war effort because Japanese fighter planes were taking off from the island and intercepting American bomber planes.\n\nHal Buell, a retired AP executive news photo editor, had long discussions with Rosenthal about the flag-raising picture and in 2006 wrote a book about the famous image. It’s hard to understand the photo’s power in 1945 for Americans, who were weary of the war and horrified by the incredible number of deaths of servicemen, especially in locations in Asia most had never heard of, Buell said.\n\n“People were just tired of the war, and all of a sudden out of nowhere came this picture that encapsulated everything,” Buell said. “It showed that victory was ultimately possible.”\n\nBuell said after Rosenthal shot the photo, the flag-raisers quickly moved on to other tasks, and it was impossible for him to get their names. That task was left to the Marines after the picture prompted an overwhelming response and the government decided to use the image in an upcoming sale of war bonds to finance the continued fighting.\n\nThe identification of the six servicemen has been accepted for decades, but the World-Herald reported that while recovering from an operation, Foley had lots of time on his hands and began noticing possible discrepancies in the picture. He enlisted the help of Krelle, who maintains a website dedicated to the Marines’ 5th Division.\n\nAfter examining the famous photo along with other pictures taken that day of the men, they concluded that the man identified as Bradley was actually Harold Henry Schultz, a private first class from Detroit. Schultz died in 1995.\n\nKrelle declined to comment on the Marines’ investigation, telling the World-Herald he had signed a confidentiality agreement with a third party. A message left by the AP at a phone number listed for Krelle wasn’t immediately returned.\n\nIn 2014, Krelle had told the newspaper, “People can hold onto what they have always known in the past. But to me, the photos are the truth.”\n\nDiscrepancies identified by Krelle and Foley included:\n\nBradley’s son, James Bradley, wrote a best-selling book about the flag-raisers, “Flags of Our Fathers,” which was later made into a movie directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\nBradley told the AP he was shocked to hear the Marines were investigating the identity of the men.\n\n“This is unbelievable,” said Bradley, who interviewed the surviving Marines and Rosenthal before writing his book.\n\n“I’m interested in facts and truths, so that’s fine, but I don’t know what’s happening,” he added.\n\nThe Marines didn’t give a timeline for the investigation.",

It was held on the New York University campus.\n\n''We have more technical expertise than the managing agents,'' said Ray W. Hoey, president of the council. All 11 members of the group's executive committee serve on the boards of their buildings.\n\nThe council was founded in 1975 to pool the knowledge acquired by co-op residents who had transformed themselves from tenants who let landlords and owners worry over the details of business into managers of what amounted to multimillion-dollar enterprises.\n\nYesterday's conference was the group's most ambitious undertaking to date - composed of 25 lectures, technical and philosophical, on topics including taxes, boilers, mortgages, meters, audits, titles and fossil fuel vs. natural gas. The fees ranged from $10 to $60, depending on whether a person was a member of the council.\n\nThe soaring cost of energy, and devices available to cope with it, was a topic sure to attract board members whose buildings have long been cooperative, according Mr. Hoey. ''We're looking at windows we have never looked at before,'' he said, referring to his own building on West End Avenue, a co-op for seven years. Free Legal Advice\n\nThe organizers of the conference stressed their personal involvement in the subject at hand. Marc Luxemburg, a lawyer and chairman of the council's executive committee, was asked in one of the classrooms whether he provided legal advice to the board of his West End Avenue building.\n\n''Unfortunately, yes,'' Mr. Luxemburg replied. ''We're too cheap to hire an outsider.'' A number of newcomers to the co-op scene seemed eager to learn anything they could. Seven of the 10 board members of 425 Prospect Place, a five-month-old co-op in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, came to the conference and split up strategically to attend as many lectures as possible and compare notes later.\n\n''We're all very concerned,'' said Joanne Nabors, the board president. ''Most of us are tenant shareholders for the first time. Everything's a new concept for us - managing agents, insurance, you name it.''\n\nFive residents of 101 West 12th Street, converted in June 1980, showed up at the gathering. ''The laws are constantly changing,'' said Helen Sisserson, a board member. ''We ended up hiring a professional staff to manage the building, but the tenants have to supervise them,'' said Larry Rosen, explaining the need to keep up to date on housing regulations.\n\nThe council, which is supported by dues, does not involve itself in questions of whether or how buildings should be converted into a cooperatives, concentrating instead on what happens when the conversion process is completed.\n\nMayor Koch expressed his endorsement of the group's work yesterday through Anthony B. Gliedman, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, who represented Mr. Koch at the conference.\n\n''I have never seen an association more appropriate in time or place than this,'' Mr. Gliedman said. ''Both the Mayor and I want to see this effort continue and expand.''",

I can tell you, it took a rare sort of character to go out there and do what they did. I used to ask myself, why the hell should these guys fight? Why?''\n\nThe speaker is David Williams, reflecting on his World War II experience as a captain with the 761st Tank Battalion. Mr. Williams, now a stockbroker for E. F. Hutton in Florida, is white, but almost everyone else in the 761st Tank Battalion was black.\n\nMr. Williams has told the story of the 761st, one of the few black World War II units permitted to take part in combat in ''Hit Hard,'' published recently by Bantam Books. One of some 75 ''Bantam War Books,'' ''Hit Hard'' is the first on a black unit.\n\nDuring World War II, most black soldiers were not in combat units, but were segregated into all-black service units. The military services were not integrated until after the war.\n\nWhat did the 761st do? The unit's Presidential Unit Citation commended the men for ''extraordinary heroism'' during 183 days of World War II combat in Europe in 1944 and 1945. The 761st inflicted thousands of casualties on the enemy, and captured, destroyed or liberated more than 30 major towns, four airfields, three ammunition-supply dumps, 461 wheeled vehicles, 34 tanks, 113 large guns and a radio station.\n\nThe unit suffered a 50 percent casualty rate and lost 71 tanks while battling in adverse weather conditions on terrain unsuited to armor operations and with shortages of replacement personnel.\n\nThe citation also described the 761st as ''the first United States Army tank battalion committed to battle comprised of black soldiers.''\n\nMr. Williams's book tells the story of the 761st - the battalion that wore the Black Panther patch - from its formation and training in Deep South Army camps through battles fought across Europe.\n\nMr. Williams, who was the unit's captain and commanding officer and who won the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts, said that the unit deserved to be decorated. Camp Life 'Ghastly'\n\nFor the 761st, life in Camp Claiborne in Lousiana and at Fort Hood in Texas was, Mr. Williams said recently by telephone, ''ghastly.'' ''The toughest battles we fought were here - spiritually,'' he said. ''At least in Europe we could strike back at an enemy. In the States what the hell could you do?''\n\nThe unit was one of those dispatched into combat because the black press, civil-rights groups and, most prominently, Eleanor Roosevelt, the First Lady, put pressure on the War Department to have black soldiers do more than build bridges, dig ditches, load and unload cargo ships and trucks, and cook and wait on white officers.\n\nThe 761st battled in France; then in Germany, where it pierced the Siegfried Line, and then in Belgium, where it tangled with the enemy in the Battle of the Bulge. It also fought in Luxembourg and Austria. In all, it went from Vic-sur-Seille, France, to the Enns River in Steyr, Austria, where it linked up with the Soviet Army.\n\n''We're dying off,'' Mr. Williams said. ''We want this to be in the history books so some little black kid can know that his great-granddaddy or granddaddy did something besides sling horse manure in World War II.''\n\n''We feel, all of us,'' Mr. Williams said, ''when we see Bryant Gumbel on TV, black kids working for I.B.M,, that we had something to do with it. We know this, we helped desegregate, that's for sure.'' Williams Also Changed\n\nMr. Williams described himself as ''a young punk out of Yale who also changed as the action went along. I was a snob,'' adding: ''I didn't know anything about Negroes. We had two people, a chauffeur and a very fine lady, working for us. Because I didn't know anything about a ghetto, I was the most unlikely candidate to be with black troops. I was very high-ranking in my O.C.S. - Officer Candidate School - class, I was a 90-day wonder, they asked me if I wanted to go'' - to the 761st - ''I didn't know the difference. But I got my manhood from them.''\n\nCalvin Cambridge also grew up in the 761st. Mr. Cambridge, now a resident of Binghamton, N. Y., and an employee of the International Business Machines Corporation, remembers the experience of a black New Yorker going to war. ''We had people of varying ages in the organization and people from different parts of the country. That caused us to grow up pretty damn fast,'' he said by telephone. He entered the army at 18 and afterward was assigned to the tank battalion.\n\nOverseas, ''it was very, very uncommon to see black soldiers in combat,'' he said, ''Toward the end of the war there were quite a few, but up to the point when we went in, there weren't that many. There were some artillery organizations; you had a couple of tank destroyers, but we were few and far between. We had more discrimination from the Americans than the Europeans. As a matter of fact, we were treated a lot better by the Europeans than the Americans. Of course, that wasn't 100 percent. There were a few nice guys in some organizations.'' Mr. Cambridge, a staff sergeant at World War II's end, remained in the Army for 20 years. Unit Citation in 1979",

        "instruction": "HOUSTON — With billions of dollars in penalties at stake, the civil trial of the British oil company BP begins its second phase Monday, which will set the amount of oil that spilled into the Gulf of Mexico from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion, which killed 11 workers and soiled hundreds of miles of beaches.\n\nThe government will argue that a total 4.2 million barrels of oil was discharged into the sea over 87 days, the equivalent of nearly one-quarter of all the oil that is consumed in the United States in a day. BP will counter that the number was closer to 2.45 million barrels. This phase of the trial will also determine if BP prepared adequately for a blowout and if it responded properly once the oil started flowing.\n\nBoth sides will present their case in US District Court in New Orleans using competing technical calculations over the next four weeks. Hanging in the balance are Clean Water Act fines that range from a maximum of $1,100 for every barrel spilled through simple negligence to as much as $4,300 a barrel if a company is found to have been grossly negligent.\n\n“This will be largely a battle of experts,” Blaine G. LeCesne, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans.\n\nThe first phase of the trial, which took place over two months this year, centered on whether BP and its contractors were guilty of gross negligence — tantamount to wanton and reckless behavior — in causing the blowout of the Macondo well.\n\nJudge Carl J. Barbier has not ruled yet on the question in the bench trial. But if he agrees with the government’s position that there was gross negligence and that 4.2 million barrels was spilled, the fines could amount to more than $18 billion.\n\n“They would have to sell assets to keep the company afloat,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. “It would wipe out all of their cash.”\n\nBut if BP’s position is upheld that there was simple negligence and only 2.45 million barrels was spilled, then the total fines would amount to roughly $2.7 billion. In all likelihood, a decision or settlement will reach a dollar figure in between, legal experts say.\n\nBP pleaded guilty in 2012 to 14 criminal charges, including manslaughter, and admitted negligence in misreading important tests before the explosion. It also agreed to pay $4.5 billion in fines and other penalties. Four current or former employees also face criminal charges.\n\nThe second phase of the trial will determine not only how much oil spilled, but whether BP was negligent or grossly negligent for not being prepared for a spill and during its efforts to stem the flow of the well between April and July 2010.\n\nThe plaintiffs, which include the federal government, several Gulf states, and private claims seekers, have argued in papers that BP “repeatedly lied to key decision makers about the flow rate of the well.”\n\nThe contractors Halliburton and Transocean have joined with the plaintiffs and government in arguing that BP lied about the flow rate, delaying the final capping of the well.\n\nTransocean has already pleaded guilty for its role in the spill and agreed to pay $1.4 billion in civil and criminal fines.

        "instruction": "JERUSALEM, Nov. 15— The guessing game surrounding the peace plan of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Fahd -would he or would he not recognize Israel? - has been generating considerable impatience here, mainly because Israelis think they know the answer very well. Optimism comes hard to a country besieged, vilified and repeatedly attacked by hostile neighbors over the decades. The impulse is to hear the Arab voices of extremism and to dismiss those of moderation, to see radicalism as reality and conciliation as duplicity.\n\nArab affairs experts in Israel, fluent in Arabic and skilled at sifting through nuances in published and broadcast material from Middle Eastern capitals, develop a sixth sense like that of the veteran Kremlinologist who spends a lifetime dissecting Pravda. The Israelis know - they simply know - that they understand the Arab world more completely than do Americans and Western Europeans.\n\nConsequently, there has not been much debate here about the Saudi proposals, not even the ambiguous seventh point supporting ''the rights of the states of the region to live in peace,'' which President Reagan believes makes ''implicit in the offering of that plan recognition of Israel's right to exist as a nation,'' as he said last week in a news conference.\n\nIsraeli analysts scoff at this interpretation. They say that in the original Arabic the text of the Saudi plan fails to use the word ''all'' in referring to the ''states of the region,'' although a translation of Prince Fahd's plan by the Saudi press agency did use the word ''all.'' The Israelis note that the Saudis have never referred to Israel as a legitimate state, only as ''the Zionist entity.''\n\nFurthermore, one expert observed, official Saudi newspapers have prominently displayed articles on the opposite interpretation by radical Arabs - that this point does not mean coexistence with Israel.\n\nA softer interpretation of the plan was put forth last week by the acting Saudi delegate to the United Nations, Gaafar M. Allagany, who said, ''It does recognize Israel.'' Mr. Allagany also contended that the seventh point did say ''all states.''\n\nHowever, Israel's Cabinet spokesman, Arye Naor, when asked today about Mr. Allagany's remarks, said, ''The Israeli Government's position remains unchanged.''\n\nIsrael has long experience in watching Arab leaders flirt with moderate positions, then skip away. Now and then, Yasir Arafat and others in the Palestine Liberation Organization have been reported as indicating their willingness to leave Israel in peace if a Palestinian nation comes into existence next door in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But after the reports are published, the Arabs usually say that they have been misquoted or misunderstood. Prince Fahd Denies Remarks\n\nThat was Prince Fahd's maneuver after an interview with The Washington Post on May 25, 1980, in which he referred to Jews as cousins (''We are all Semites''), expressed support for United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which affirms the ''sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace,'' and offered to bring other Arabs to negotiations if Israel declared its willingness to withdraw from occupied lands.\n\nFour days later, according to an Israeli official, the Prince told the Moroccan press agency that he had been misquoted. A month later, he called for a holy war against Israel.\n\nThe zigs and the zags are understood here as attempts to play to competing audiences of Americans and Europeans on one hand, and militant Arabs on the other.\n\nIsraelis tend to see the peace plan as a reaffirmation of the longterm Arab goal of deep Israeli concessions, not as a movement toward the American or Israeli position. The Saudis, in the Israeli view, see the Israelis as aliens in an Arab region.\n\nThe proposals, put forth in August after Saudi disappointment in the Reagan Administration's renewed endorsement of Camp David, call for Israeli withdrawal from all territories captured in the 1967 war; the dismantling of settlements in occupied lands; the freedom of religious practice in Jerusalem; the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people and compensation for all Palestinians ''who do not wish to return to their homeland''; a transition period under United Nations supervision in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; the creation of a Palestinian nation with East Jerusalem as its capital; an affirmation of the right of countries in the region to live in peace, and a guarantee of the plan by the United Nations ''or some of its members.'' Begin Backed on Saudi Plan\n\nThe Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin attracted support from across the political spectrum for its unequivocal rejection of the proposals, which Mr. Begin said were prescriptions for the liquidation of Israel.\n\nBut a few lonely voices were raised in dissent, mainly over tactics. They asked why, if the experts were so sure that the implicit recognition of Israel was a bluff, did not the Government just hit the ball back into Prince Fahd's court.\n\nIn May 1980, for example, the Saudi flexibility vanished after Prime Minister Begin followed Prince Fahd's Washington Post interview by inviting the Saudi to visit Jerusalem and address Parliament, as had President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt in 1977. No such invitation was extended this time.\n\nThere was embarrassment here at the mildly favorable remarks about point seven last week by Moshe Arens, the chairman of Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee and the choice to be the next Israeli Ambassador to the United States. Mr. Arens, who headed a parliamentary delegation to explain Israel's opposition to the plan, told reporters after a meeting with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.:\n\n''When Saudi Arabia today releases a document - although it refuses to name Israel by name - leaves it open to the possible interpretation that it might under certain circumstances - unacceptable to Israel, unfortunately - be ready to recognize the right of Israel to exist, you might say this is a step ahead and that maybe in Saudi Arabia, as in Egypt some years ago, there is a realization penetrating that nothing is going to beat Israel on the battlefield.'' 'In the Right Direction'\n\nHe went on to say that the plan itself was ''totally unacceptable'' and that point seven went ''a little way in the right direction, but a long way from making Saudi Arabia a partner for peace negotiations with Israel.''\n\nNevertheless, he had sounded too much like President Reagan and not enough like Prime Minister Begin. After a phone conversation with the Prime Minister, he beat a hasty retreat, calling point seven ''a step sideways.''\n\nIsrael's response to the apparent wavering of Washington's commitment to the Camp David accords has been to devise a guessing game of its own.\n\n''We have reached, even passed, the limits of our concessions,'' Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said. ''The reaction of the West and their present attitude to the Arab oil-producing states may cause us to reassess our attitude.''\n\nIt was purposely left unclear just what would be reassessed. ''It is not a threat,'' said an official enigmatically, ''just a warning.''\n\nIllustrations: Map of Egypt and Israel Photo of Prince Fahd Photo of Mechnachem Begin",

The present owner, the Torontobased Thomson Organization, subsidized The Times publications here last year with $30 million.\n\n''Subsidization is always a rotten foundation for any newspaper,'' the editorial said. ''If Mr. Murdoch can make The Times a commercially viable newspaper, he will have done us the greatest possible service.''\n\nIt said Mr. Murdoch had given ''satisfactory guarantees of editorial independence'' in the detailed statement of safeguards published yesterday as part of the sale agreement. And his business interests were also ''free of other commitments (such, for instance, as extensive commitments in the Middle East) which might cut across fair reporting.''\n\nMoreover, the paper said, he had proved through successful operation of the largest daily and the largest Sunday newspapers in Britain that he could get along with the unions and improve ''the relationship which has threatened our survival.'' Unions Predict Cooperation\n\nAs if to prove that, several union leaders expressed confidence today that they could come to new agreements within the three-week deadline that Mr. Murdoch has set for himself, despite his intention to make ''considerable'' reductions in the number of employees at The Times.\n\n''The general feeling among union leaders is that it is possible to reach an agreement by next month,'' said Bill Keys, the chairman of the printing industries committee of the Trades Union Congress.\n\nThe most notable exception among the employee groups was the National Union of Journalists, some of whose members were ''absolutely horrified'' by the prospect of working for Mr. Murdoch, according to their chairman, Jacob Ecclestone.\n\nThe journalists have been distressed by reports from Murdoch papers, especially The New York Post, of the way he involves himself personally in editorial affairs. Alluding to him in an emergency resolution passed two days before the sale was announced, the union said:\n\n''The record of proprietorial interference in editorial decisions is such that we have grave doubts that our traditions of objectivity, balance and independence could be sustained.'' Large Holdings Worry Parliament\n\nIn Parliament, objections to the deal center on the fact that Mr. Murdoch's company, News International Ltd., already has such large holdings in Britain.\n\nJohn Smith, the Labor Party's spokesman on trade, said that the sale would ''create one of the greatest concentrations of newspaper power in the history of journalism in the United Kingdom,'' and he demanded that it be scrutinized by the Government's Monopolies Commission, a move Mr. Murdoch said might dangerously delay the deal.\n\nResponding for the Government, Sally Oppenheim, a minister in the Department of Trade, promised that it would ''consider the matter very carefully.'' But she said that two relevant factors that could militate in favor of approving the sale were ''the expressed delight of the unions'' at the choice of Mr. Murdoch and the ''possible consequences'' of delay - the disappearance of The Times.\n\nIllustrations: photo of members of editorial staff of The Times of London",

Analysts attributed the decline to fears of higher interest rates.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average, which moved steadily lower throughout the session, closed off 16.07 points, to 850.46. It was the lowest closing for the Dow average since Nov. 19, when it finished at 844.75.\n\nThe stocks of A.T.& T. and I.B.M. did not open yesterday until after midday because of the influx of orders following the settlement of their antitrust suits. When they did open for trading, however, the two big corporations were the volume leaders on the Big Board. (Page D10.)\n\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph was the most active stock yesterday, rising 1 5/8 points, to 60 1/2, on a turnover of 2.6 million shares, including one block of 1.3 million shares worth $78.8 million, the third most valuable block of stock ever traded on the Big Board.\n\nI.B.M., the second most active issue, closed unchanged at 56 3/4, on a turnover of 1.8 million shares. Trading in both A.T.& T. and I.B.M. stocks was halted before noon last Friday in anticipation of the Justice Department's rulings. Volume Up, Prices Down\n\nVolume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 51.9 million shares yesterday from 42.1 million last Friday. The sharp drop in the stock market yesterday was unexpected: Most analysts had expected prices to stage a rally because of Justice Department actions ending suits against the International Business Machines Corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company that are considered likely to be beneficial for both companies and for business in general.\n\nVirtually every sector of the stock market was under selling pressure as declines on the New York Stock Ex change outscored advances by more than 5 to 1. Traditionally f avored transportation, technology and energy-related issues were the biggest casualties.\n\nThe setback in the Dow was its biggest since Jan. 5 when the key market indicator tumbled 17.22 points, to 865.30, in response to forecasts of higher interest rates by Henry Kaufman, the influential economist of Salomon Brothers. Concern Over Rates\n\nWhen interest rates rise, stock market prices often decline because investors switch from stocks to fixed-income securities to take advantage of the rising yields. Higher interest rates also increase corporate expenses, thus squeezing profits.\n\n''Investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve Board will further tighten its grip on credit because of the recent increases in the size of the nation's money supply,'' said Will iam G. Hieber Jr., presiden t of Shoenberg & Hieber Inc. He noted that the money supply has ri sen more than $10 billion in the last two months and that another large increase is expected this week.\n\nMr. Hieber noted that tight credit tends to put pressure on interest rates despite the increasing evidence that the recession is deepening. However, he predicted that stepped-up buying by the cashrich institutions in the next few weeks could ''see the market recovering, with the Dow reaching the 890 level by early February.'' Interest Rate Concerns\n\nIn the credit markets, Government, corporate and tax-exempt bond prices fell sharply yesterday, also because of fears of higher interest rates.\n\nLosses of a point or more were widespread yesterday among the blue chips. Merck dropped 2 points, to 82; General Motors, hurt by a continuing slump in car sales, fell 1 7/8, to 38 1/4; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell 1 3/8, to 52 3/8; Eastman Kodak was down 1 5/8, to 71 5/8; General Electric was down 1 1/8, to 56 1/2, and International Paper fell 1 1/2, to 36 1/4.\n\nReflecting the weakness in the railroad issues, the Dow Jones transportation index was off 12.74, to 355.93. Among the bigger losers in this category, Southern Railway fell 2 5/8 points, to 89 1/2, Southern Pacific lost 1 3/4, to 36 1/4, Missouri Pacific fell 1 1/2, to 79, and Norfolk & Western was down 1 1/8, to 48 5/8.\n\nThe larger losers in the technology group included Teledyne, which fell 6 1/8 points, to 128 7/8, despite reporting an earnings gain in 1981. Digital Equipment fell 3 1/8, to 80 3/4; Honeywell was down 3 1/4, to 64 5/8, and Texas Instruments was down 1 3/4, to 74 5/8.\n\nIn the weaker energy-related category, Pennzoil, a rumored takeover candidate, tumbled 3 3/8 points, to 39 7/8; Getty was off 2 1/8, to 57 7/8; Cities Service was down 2 3/4, to 38 1/2; Halliburton was off 2 5/8, to 46 1/4, and Schlumberger fell 1 7/8, to 49 1/4.\n\nOn the American Stock Exchange, the exchange's market value index was off 10.63, to 300.19, its biggest daily decline since Sept. 25, 1981, when it dropped 15.36. The biggest losers on the exchange yesterday were the technology and natural-resource issues.\n\nIn the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.25, to 188.80. The big gainer was Medcom Inc., which gained 13 points, to 30 1/2 bid, after the company said it had signed a letter of intent to be acquired by Baxter Travenol, a maker of medical care products, for $35 a share in cash. Baxter Travenol stock, which is traded on the Big Board, fell 1 3/8, to 31 7/8.\n\nIllustrations: Market profile graph (Page D10)",

The suit, which was filed in Illinois state court in Chicago, is seeking $10 billion in damages from the two firms.\n\nAuditing firms are generally organized as national entities, with agreements with firms with similar names in other countries, but the Parmalat suit sought to break through that legal structure and hold the international partnerships of each firm responsible for what happened at Parmalat.\n\nGrant Thornton International severed its ties with its Italian affiliate after the Parmalat scandal broke. It had been the auditor for a Parmalat subsidiary, Bonlat Financing, which was said to have $4.9 billion in an account with the Bank of America. In fact, the account did not exist.\n\nThe suit says two partners in Grant Thornton's former Italian affiliate, Lorenzo Penca and Maurizio Bianchi, ''were active conspirators with Parmalat's management in setting up fictitious companies and structuring fake transactions whose only purpose was to siphon off billions of dollars of assets from Parmalat and its subsidiaries.''\n\nIt says Deloitte, responsible for the audit of the Parmalat parent company, failed to live up to its duties. ''Despite red flag after red flag, Deloitte deliberately chose not to perform even a fraction of the required auditing procedures to satisfy itself'' of the legitimacy of companies like Bonlat Financing, the suit says.\n\n''No matter how their responsibilities are carved up, under accepted auditing standards and principles, both Deloitte and Grant Thornton, in their international as well as local domestic capacities, are legally responsible for Parmalat's enormous losses, currently estimated at over $10 billion,'' the lawsuit states.\n\nThe suit against the auditors is the second time Mr. Bondi has gone to state courts in the United States -- an unusual forum for international financial disputes -- to sue over the Parmalat collapse. Parmalat sued Citigroup last month in a New Jersey state court. The company's strategy may be to take advantage of discovery procedures, which can be extensive in the United States, to get access to documents that could help to prove its case. In widening the auditor case beyond the Italian affiliates, it is also seeking to get access to affiliates that could afford to pay more in damages.\n\nThe company has also filed suits in Italy against UBS and Deutsche Bank, two banks that helped to raise money for Parmalat before it went under.\n\nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu issued a statement calling the suit ''entirely unjustified,'' adding that its Italian auditors had raised questions that ''led to the fraud being uncovered.'' Deloitte's unit in the United States said there was no ''legitimate theory for naming us as defendants.''\n\nGrant Thornton International issued a statement noting that it had expelled the Italian affiliate and saying it ''does not accept that this is a legitimate action'' by Parmalat.\n\n''The member firms in the Grant Thornton International network are entirely independent legal, financial and administrative entities,'' the statement said.",

Turkish officials have repeatedly warned in recent weeks against any attempt by Greece to proclaim an extension of its territorial waters from 6 to 12 miles in the Aegean, where it has 2,383 islands, some only a few miles off Turkey. The Turkish Foreign Ministry says such an extension would virtually close the Aegean to Turkish traffic.\n\nA Greek proclamation could come after the end next month of the Law of the Sea Conference, which is expected to endorse the practice of establishing 12-mile sea limits.\n\nIn the past Greece has indicated that in the interest of maintaining good relations with Turkey it would not take advantage of the right to the sea-limit extension that its islands in the Aegean would give it. The Turks, however, fear a change of policy from Greece's Socialist Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, who has publicly denounced Turkey as ''a threat'' and has refused to resume talks on the Aegean. Public Warning by Turkey\n\nTurkey's Foreign Minister, Ilter Turkmen, has publicly warned Greece against any unilateral action in the Aegean. He has also told Turkey's ambassadors to alert the Atlantic allies to the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe former commander of Turkey's land forces, Gen. Esref Akinci, now a member of the consultative assembly charged with drafting a new constitution, said recently that the declaration of a 12-mile limit would turn the Aegean into a Greek lake and would be considered ''a casus belli.''\n\n''Twelve miles mean that war will become inevitable between Turkey and Greece,'' General Akinci said. A high Turkish official said it was necessary to make the nation's position clear ''because we don't want the Papandreou Government to make any miscalculations.'' In addition , the Greek opposition leader, Evangelos Averoff, was recently quot ed by the Turkish press as saying, ''By following a policy of ten sion with Turkey, at a time when Greece has l ost international support, she is playing with fire.'' Papandreou Asserts Greek Rights\n\nMr. Papandreou said several times in his election campaign last year that Greece had the right to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles. In addition, his Government's program says that Greece's land, air and sea frontiers and the limits of the Greek continental shelf in the Aegean ''are not negotiable.'' He has made it clear that he believes Greece should control the Aegean's air and sea space, as it did before Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974.\n\nThe Turkish Government has published a map showing the effects of a Greek 12-mile limit. An official said such a move would deprive Turkey's Aegean ports of all direct exits to international waters, reduce the area of international waters to 25 percent with Greece controlling 65 percent of the sea surface and Turkey only 10 percent and drastically reduce the area of the continental shelf that Turkey could claim.\n\nLast year the two Governments held talks on the Aegean, and while there was no major breakthrough, a cordial atmosphere prevailed. There were several reciprocal gestures such as lifting of civil air prohibitions in the Aegean and curbing press attacks. Talks Going On Since 1976\n\nThe two countries have been negotiating off and on since 1976 over the delimitation of the Aegean continental shelf. Greece signed the 1958 Geneva convention that stipulates that the islands also have a continental shelf. Turkey refused to sign the convention, declaring that the Aegean is a special case.\n\nTurkey has urged the Papandreou Government to resume the talks, but the Prime Minister has refused. ''We cannot make any concessions on our sovereign rights in the Aegean,'' he told a Turkish newspaper recently. ''Greece does not and will not demand anything that does not belong to her, but she does not intend to give up anything that is hers.''",

        "instruction": "DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia— Driving north from this bustling city, the fine sand whistling across the road gives the appearance of early morning ground fog. The passing scenery includes camels, oases of date palms and, everywhere, sun-bleached, bone-white desert. On the car radio is the droning, hypnotic voice of Ummkultham, the dead Egyptian singer still revered throughout the Arab world. The title of her song: ''From Here We Start an Old Story.'' Today in Saudi Arabia, there often seem to be only new stories.\n\nThere are the traditionally dressed Saudis holding court in the opulent, atrium lobby of the Riyadh Marriott -which looks as if it belongs in Houston - as American businessmen anxiously make sales pitches.\n\nThere are the scores of pieces of modern sculpture strewn about Jidda's public places like diamonds. There is the army of bulldozers, air force of helicopters and navy of supertankers deployed in this Eastern Province, home of the world's largest oilfields. Prayers, Veils and Thieves\n\nBut there are also the persistent tuggings of the old stories - workers stopping for noon prayers at Ras Tanura, the giant crude oil loading facility; young professional women fighting for equality, who nonetheless take no offense at having to remain veiled, and what appears to be a general feeling that habitual thieves are better off without right hands.\n\nA visitor thus leaves this desert kingdom with no final judgments, only a bagful of glimpses. And one has the impression that the Saudis might be comfortable with this outcome.\n\n''My kingdom will survive only in so far as it remains a country of difficult access, where the foreigner will have no other aim with his task fulfilled but to get out,'' King Faisal once said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been compared to a luxury ocean liner. While foreigners do the work, the passengers - the Saudis - luxuriate in the sunshine. Meanwhile, the ship moves ahead.\n\nThere is some truth in this characterization. Although population statistics have not been accurately and recently compiled, analysts suggest that as many as half of the eight or nine million people believed to be here may be foreigners - mainly Pakistanis, Koreans, Filipinos and Palestinians. They are the key to Saudi ambitions to convert oil in the ground - perhaps, over time, an increasingly obsolescent resource - into industrial might that will thrust the kingdom well into the 21st century.\n\nAccordingly, the Saudis seem to go to great lengths to make the foreign laborers feel at home. At the new industrial sites of Jubail and Yanbu, for instance, representatives of 55 nationalities are offered nat ive ethnic cuisine, the latest in recreational amenities and free education. In addition, foreigners, like Saudis, pay no income tax and are free to transfer earnings outside the kingdom. 'The Saudi Arrogance'\n\nNonetheless, there is irritation among some expatriates encountered around the kingdom. ''You could call it rent-a-slave,'' a Turk complained.\n\nTo be sure, foreigners make much more money than they would in their own countries. Otherwise, they would not have come to this often-blistering wasteland. And to a certain extent, the domineering qualities some claim to resent in the Saudis are an understandable response to their own groveling behavior. ''People will humiliate themselves just for that buck,'' a university sociologist said. ''That helps reinforce the Saudi arrogance.''\n\nFor Riyadh's horsy set, it is another day at the races. At least a dozen of Saudi Arabia's 4,000 princes lounge in the front row, relaxing in sumptuous armchairs while sipping sweet mint tea and bitter cardamom-flavored green coffee. They have left at least three Rolls Royces, two Cadillacs, one Mercedes limousine and one Jaguar sports car in the parking lot out front.\n\nThe princes, wearing white robes and red-checked head cloths, are proud owners of what they call Arab horses, a characterization that is the subject of some controversy. The reason is that the animals are not exactly the big-eyed, dish-faced Arabians the rest of the equestrian world instantly recognizes. ''They're Arabs infused with a great many other breeds,'' said an Englishwoman sitting in an unpadded seat several rows back. ''But that's a very forbidden subject of conversation around here.''\n\nPrince Yazid ben Saudi al-Aziz smiles broadly after his horse won the third of seven races. He said the horses, many of whom sport intricately braided manes, are ''desert-type horses'' that represent the ''history of this country.'' The young prince said that one of his steeds had just won a major stakes in England. ''I have about 80 horses here, there and everywhere,'' he said.\n\nPrince Yazid explained that his occupation was overseeing horses owned by the Ministry of Interior, giving the distinct impression that his service has been long and arduous. In a burst of laughter, a friend later confided that the Prince had held the post - his first job ever - for less than a week.\n\nThe early morning scene is a highway knifing through the desert, about halfway between Riyadh and Dhahran. The driver, Abdulaziz Mohammed, inexplicably pulls off the road, driving about 300 yards across barren dirt and rocks.\n\nThe trunk is opened, an Oriental-style rug is spread and then, there is an instant picnic. Mr. Mohammed serves his three companions, two Americans and a Saudi, coffee and tea, fresh dates, fruit and a tasty warm concoction made from rice, dates and a battery of spices.\n\nThe credit for the cooking, he said, should go to his wife. Shaking his head, he said he regretted that he might soon have to replace her with a younger woman - divorce being relatively common in Saudi Arabia but not generally a topic of conversation. But where, the visitors wondered, might he find as accomplished a chef? With an enormous grin, Mr. Mohammed answered, ''I can teach cooking but no one, I believe, can teach youth.''\n\nThe Jidda Islamic Port annually imports 8,000 tons of live camels, equal to nearly 20,000 of the dour, independent beasts. Indeed, the port has the distinction of being the largest importer of livestock of any harbor in the world. More than two million sheep, for instance, enter this kingdom across its docks each year.\n\nOn a recent day, Sudanese shepherds clad in wraparound skirts and white turbans herded hundreds, perhaps thousands, of bleating goats past truckloads of Moroccan oranges and scores of scurrying forklift vehicles laden with Japanese steel cable. With considerable brandishing of canes, the goats were ushered aboard brightly painted Mercedes trucks.\n\nThe port has come a long way since the mid-1970's. The number of berths has increased from 10 to 44, storage space has risen from 55,000 square yards to more than 5.5 million square yards and an independent port authority has taken control.\n\nDespite the progress, the port still gives testimony to a central reality of Saudi Arabia - it imports virtually all its needs and exports little besides oil. Only dilapidated used cars destined for Egypt or the Sudan, scrap iron and a few dates are exported from Jidda. The hundreds of modern containers that arrive each day, for the most part, are shipped back empty.\n\nIllustrations: photo of a wworker in Yemen",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, June 17— Conrail, the 17,000-mile, Federally subsidized railroad, achieved an operating profit of nearly $10 million in May after a loss of $13 million in the previous month, Congress was told today.\n\nL. Stanley Crane, chairman and chief executive officer of the line, whose official name is the Consolidated Rail Corporation, told the Senate Commerce Committee that the railroad would probably show a profit for the second quarter.\n\nIf there is a quarterly profit, he said, it would be only the second in Conrail's five-year history; the first was in the second quarter of 1979. Conrail, which operates primarily in the Northeast, lost $187 million in 1980.\n\nMr. Crane said that the railroad's profit in May came despite the coal miners' strike, which reduced shipments of coal by rail. Coal traffic represents about 30 percent of Conrail's total tonnage and about 16 percent of its revenues, he said. Compared with April and May of 1980, coal carloads were down about 60 percent, to 67,000 from 160,000, for a loss of about $60 million in revenues.\n\nMr. Crane's report on Conrail's second-quarter earnings outlook is signficant in light of management's request for time to reverse the line's losses and thus avert a Reagan Administration plan to dismember the 17-state system and sell off its profitable lines while closing or giving away the unprofitable lines.\n\nThe Federal Government has invested more than $6 billion to subsidize Conrail and finance improvements in the railroad since its formation in 1976 from six bankrupt private lines.\n\nMeanwhile, organized labor today opposed legislation introduced by Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, and supported by the Reagan Administration, which it said ''appears to be designed both by tone and language to secure the ultimate dismantling of Conrail over a period of some 18 months.'' The bill would permit Conrail to be sold off, but not before 1983.\n\nConrail employs about 70,000 workers. In an effort to avoid the proposed sell-off of the railroad, the employees and management agreed recently to forgo $229 million in wage increases for workers and executives. ---- Plan on Marginal Lines Special to the New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON, June 17 - Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis said today that he would be willing to dispose of Conrail branch rail lines to shipper groups or others who want to operate them after appropriate legislation is passed by Congress.\n\nSuch a provision is now contained in a Senate bill that would allow the Department of Transportation to sell marginal lines, with Conrail's consent, at discount prices.\n\nMr. Lewis made his remarks at a seminar conducted by the National Industrial Traffic League, a major shippers' organization. Conrail officials in Philadelphia declined to comment.\n\nIn other matters, Mr. Lewis said that he endorsed a Senate bill that would provide some delay in the Administration plan to sell off Conrail while keeping up the pressure to make the railroad profitable during the next two years, but he said that a House version of the Conrail legislation that could further delay the sale was unacceptable.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON— The Supreme Court last week gave President Reagan an opportunity and a lesson. The opportunity came with the unexpected retirement of Associate Justice Potter Stewart, a moderate, essentially nonideological jurist. His departure will let Mr. Reagan put his stamp on the Court sooner than anticipated. The lesson was in the separation of powers; it will retain its validity no matter whom Mr. Reagan names to Justice Stewart's seat.\n\nThe Court decided the two most important regulatory cases of the term in ways that substantially undercut the Administration's antiregulation agenda. First, the Justices unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the Federal strip-mining law, which James G. Watt, Interior Secretary, believed unconstitutional. Then, voting 5 to 3 with Justice Stewart dissenting, the Court told the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that it is legally obliged to protect workers from toxic substances to the full extent feasible, without regard to balancing the costs to an industry and the benefits to its employees.\n\nThe White House, which has ordered all agencies to subject their regulations to a cost-benefit analysis, had tried to persuade the Court not to decide the worker-safety issue - the case argued involved the dangers of cotton dust - and to let the regulators resolve the cost-benefit question. The Court disposed of that unusual request in a footnote midway through its 49-page opinion, saying only ''we decline to adopt the suggestion'' that the case be returned to the Secretary of Labor.\n\nThe Court's message was unmistakable. Our job, the Justices were saying, is to interpret the law. The executive branch can enforce it or ask Congress to change it, but cannot circumvent the legislative mandate through bureaucratic gamesmanship.\n\nThere was no word from the Administration as to whether it will ask Congress to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act to permit cost-benefit analysis. Certainly there is no guarantee that such an effort would succeed. It could well be true that if starting from scratch today, Congress would pass a different worker-protection act, less sweeping than the legislation enacted in 1970. But as the Administration learned when forced to abandon its proposals for sharp reductions in Social Security benefits, it is hard to take away longstanding benefits that have come to be regarded as vested rights by a well-organized and highly committed segment of society.\n\nWhatever the results of an amendment effort, Mr. Reagan may have derived grim comfort from the fact that in last week's decisions, at least to anyone reading the political winds, the Court looked as if it were out of phase with the rest of Washington. With antiregulation fever running high, and the Court under the most concerted attack in years on basic issues of its power and jurisdiction, the Justices delivered a sweeping endorsement of Federal regulatory authority. It was a discordant note in a capital whose theme is the Reagan ''mandate.''\n\nThat the mandate is not the Supreme Court's preoccupation is hardly surprising. The Court last week was playing its own tune in one of its most time-honored roles: balance wheel in the fast-moving machine of electoral politics. The Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Surface Mining Act were adopted when the environmental and consumer movements of the last decade were at their peaks, a time when the public looked eagerly to the Federal Government as protector and guarantor of safety and welfare. With unusual speed, the pendulum is swinging back. But because it has taken years for the key challenges to those laws to reach the Supreme Court docket, the Justices, merely by taking the words of the statutes at face value, injected a new, if unwelcome, vitality into unfashionable doctrines.\n\nPrevious changes in prevailing political and social perceptions have found the Court out of phase with Congress and the White House. Franklin D. Roosevelt nearly provoked a constitutional crisis in his wrath over the Court's refusal to uphold his New Deal programs. Vacancies on the Court eventually allowed him to find Justices with more sympathy for his vision of the role of the Federal Government.\n\nThe events of last week hardly compare to the drama of Roosevelt's Court-packing days and President Reagan needs no reinforcement for his determination to reshape the Court in his image. In fact, he received none. A Reagan replacement for Justice Stewart casting a vote in either the strip-mining or cotton dust cases would have made no difference in their outcomes. Justice Stewart's retirement, however, could have a greater impact on the Court than immediately seems apparent.\n\nBy leaving the bench gracefully and at a relatively youthful 66, he has set an example for those of his colleagues who may be tempted to follow. Men like Lewis F. Powell and Harry A. Blackmun, both moderate conservatives, both older than 70, could also decide to leave while they are still in good health and their intellectual faculties are unimpaired.\n\nObservers of the Supreme Court who speculate about such things noted last week that the speed with which other Justices follow Justice Stewart's example could depend on how President Reagan uses his opportunity. Campaigning for office, Mr. Reagan promised to name a woman to fill ''among the first Supreme Court vacancies in my Administration.'' Several women, including Carla Hills, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Ford, and Elizabeth H. Dole, assistant to the President for public liaison and the wife of Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, have been suggested.\n\nMan or woman, however, if President Reagan's choice is a mainstream conservative with respectable legal credentials, some of the older Justices may be reassured that their replacements would be of an acceptable mold. But a highly political appointee with a weak legal background that drew criticism from the establishment bar would be likely, in the words of one Court-watcher, to induce the potential retirees to ''hang on forever.'' Last week, Mr. Reagan was the Court's student. In the next few months it will be his turn to set the example.\n\nIllustrations: photo of a textile worker, suffering from brown lung disease, at a",

        "instruction": "When the late George G. Heye was working in Arizona as a mining engineer at the turn of the century, he spotted a Navajo Indian mending an embroidered shirt. He bought it for $5. Some 400,000 Indian artifacts later, Heye established the Museum of the American Indian on May 10, 1916, and turned over his holdings, with an endowment, to the trustees of the newly created institution.\n\nOn Sunday the museum, now in possession of nearly a million objects and bursting out of its columned Beaux-Arts building on Audubon Terrace (Broadway and 155th Street), celebrates its 65th birthday with a round of exhibitions and events. For one, there is ''Glimpses at 65'' (through Nov. 1), a tribute to the Heye achievement that traces the museum's history, with several key artifacts; plus archival material, books and photographs.\n\nOn the third floor, there is ''Arctic Art: Eskimo Ivory'' (through Sept. 30), a beautifully installed show of 200 ivory carvings from Greenland, Alaska, Siberia and Canada, the first presentation in the new temporary exhibition gallery that the museum has shoehorned into its all-too-finite space. And another third-floor exhibition, ''Where the Jaguars Are Exalted: Animals in the Art of Middle America,'' with innovative lighting and placement of objects, marks a departure in the museum's timeworn display techniques. Momaday to Read Poetry\n\nWhat's more, from 1 to 5 P.M. on Sunday, the public is invited to a celebratory program that includes poetry readings by the Pulitzer prize-winning author N. Scott Momaday, a Kiowa Indian, who is a trustee of the museum; screenings of historical museum films; entertainment by members of the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers; guided tours of the exhibition halls, a slide presentation and a shop sale, with emphasis on Navajo rugs. Although the charge for admission is normally $1.50 for adults (75 cents for students and the elderly), the Sunday program is free.\n\nThe ''Glimpses at 65'' minishow gives a sense of the early Heye days and the acquisitions made by the former mining engineer and Wall Street banker, who served as the museum's director from 1916 to 1956, the year before his death. There are Heye memorabilia and objects from the collection, including specimen 0/0001, a thousandyear-old black-and-white clay bowl, taken from Pueblo ruins in New Mexico in 1888, the first item catalogued by the museum. Red Cloud's 1883 Letter\n\nAlso, from the museum's 40,000-volume library, housed in an annex in the Bronx, there is a letter addressed to Congress in 1883 by the Sioux chief Red Cloud, regarding payment for Sioux horses seized by Federal soldiers in 1876. The museum's photographic archives, with 70,000 items, are represented by a small album put together in 1906 by Frank Churchill, an Indian agent, showing Chippewas moving to a reservation.\n\nBut the real treat is the show of Arctic ivories, a revelation for those who've associated Eskimo art primarily with the cute soapstone carvings seen in shops. Before this presentation, very little of the museum's splendid Arctic-art collection had been exhibited or published, and the occasion is marked by an informative catalogue ($19.95) written by James G.E. Smith, the museum's curator of North American ethnology, with illustrations of every item in the show.\n\nThere are walrus tusks carved with symbols and stories, engraved tools, wooden sun hats with ivory decorations, a whaling-ship model made entirely of ivory, elaborately carved ivory pipes, objects of shamanistic ritual, toys, games, amulets, hunting and fishing tackle, whalebone baskets and all manner of other handsome objects, both useful and decorative, that are surprising in their design sophistication. A Kayak and 'Nanook,' Too\n\nA genuine kayak lends a bit of theater to the display. The show is also enhanced by a continuous showing of Robert Flaherty's great film ''Nanook of the North''; a slide presentation in which decorative carvings of Eskimo pursuits are juxtaposed with photographs of the same activities today, and sound effects, ranging from Arctic wolf howls to the laughter of children at play.\n\nViewers may also roam through the permanent exhibits, which give a sampling of the nearly one million artifacts (by recent inventory) owned by the museum and said to be the finest and most comprehensive in the world. The museum has unstintingly obeyed its mandate ''to collect, preserve, study and exhibit all things connected with the aboriginal peoples of North, Central and South America.''\n\nAmong the strengths of its holdings are carvings in wood, horn and stone from the Northwest Coast of North America, kachina dance masks and dolls from the American Southwest (the Hopi Indians alone are represented by more than 700 dolls), textiles of Peru, Mexico and the Navajo, basketry from the Southwest and California, pottery from the Southwest, Southeast and Peru, sophisticated goldwork from Colombia, Mexico and Peru, Olmec and Mayan jade, Eskimo carved masks, Aztec mosaics, Amazonian and Peruvian featherwork, painted hides and costumes from the North American Plains. Proposed Move to Custom House\n\nBut alas, in the sadly inadequate Audubon Terrace facility, only a small portion of the collection is on view, in overcrowded, badlydesigned displays. For lack of exhibition space, most of the objects repose in a Bronx storage facility. The museum has been negotiating with the Federal Government for some time, in hopes that it will be given quarters in the capacious United States Custom House near Battery Park, where it has already staged two major, heavily attended exhibitions. But Federal officials, who have marked the building for extensive renovation, have so far made no commitment.\n\n''We've demonstrated what we can do,'' says Dr. Roland W. Force, the museum's director. ''We ought to be in New York City, but unless we can work out an adequate location, and the Custom House is our best, we'll be forced out.''\n\nDr. Force and the museum's trustees are hoping for an endorsement from the city for occupany of the Custom House. They would also like help from Congress in persuading the Federal Government of the museum's need to occupy the Custom House. And so perhaps it's significant, though no one has publicly made the connection, that tonight, at a dinner at ''21,'' the museum will honor Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, highly regarded by American Indians for his legislative efforts in their behalf, with the first Heye Medal for ''distinguished service in Indian affairs.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Eskimo carving",

Some may have clinical outcomes and influence disease development. That is why we are interested in genetic variation. That will help us understand when we do disease studies.\"\n\nThe huge sample of 8,200 ethnic Chinese participants were drawn from 10 Chinese provinces and Singapore.\n\nInterestingly, the scientists also found genetic variants between different Chinese dialect groups.\n\n\"Different dialect groups are definitely not identical ... language is a reflection of our evolution, that's why you see the differences,\" Liu said.\n\nThe team has since moved on to try to establish if these gene variants may be linked to the tendency among certain groups of Chinese to develop particular diseases -- such as nasopharyngeal cancer, which is more prevalent among southern Chinese, but not Chinese in northern provinces.\n\nThe team appears to have made some headway with two chronic autoimmune diseases - psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nPsoriasis causes red scaly patches on the skin, while SLE is a connective tissue disease that often harms the heart, joints, skin, lungs, blood vessels, liver, kidneys and nervous system.\n\n\"We looked (at genes of) 1,000 psoriasis patients and 1,000 people without the disease. Those with psoriasis had particular genetic variants in three positions that we identified,\" Liu said.\n\n\"These variants are very common in patients and very rare in non-patients. We look at where these variants are located and we are able to nail the genes, and the genes can provide information why certain people develop this disease.\"",

        "instruction": "A block of four stamps, the third segment in a four-part series delineating American architecture from Colonial times to the present, is being issued this Friday in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe new American Architecture issue is devoted to the closing decades of the 19th century and the opening decades of this century. It covers a period when architects became eclectic and ceased to be committed to a particular style. A few of them struck out in new directions and gave shape to structures that heralded the architecture of today.\n\nThe initial 1979 block of four depicted the neoclassic architecutral style that began toward the end of the American Revolution. Forms derived from the classic periods of Greece and Rome. Last year's segment pictured Gothic Revival derived from the Middle Ages, marked by pointed arches, flying buttresses and lofty turrets that generated the romantic towers and Victorian massiveness so popular through much of the 19th century.\n\nEclectic architecture, in turn, selected forms and details from any of the styles or buildings of the past. In more extreme instances, forms or details were taken from more than one building or style and recombined into the design for a single building. The melange of styles brought a strange look to many American cities filled with an array of incompatible office buildings.\n\nThe first day of issue will be held at the National Building Museum, the nation's newest cultural institution located in the historic Pension Building in the capital. The National Building Musuem is a privately funded organization mandated by Congress in 1980 to commemorate and encourage the American building arts. The Pension Building was erected in 1882 for the 1,500 clerks needed to process the pensions awarded to veterans of the Civil War. Reputed to be the most modern building of its time, it epitomizes the architectural practices of the period in which it was built.\n\nThe initial stamp of the third block of four, at the upper left, depicts the structure long known as the New York University Library. More familiarly known as the Gould Memorial Library, it is on the campus of the Bronx Community College of the City University of New York.\n\nThe structure was designed by Stanford White (1853-1906), who with Charles F. McKim and William R. Mead, formed the firm of McKim, Mead and White in New York City in 1879. It became one of the largest and most successful architectural firms in the world. The three partners practiced together for more than 25 years and produced more than 500 buildings including many of New York's most noted buildings. These included the Morgan Library, called the jewel of Renaissance Revival style; the Low Library at Columbia University; the Villard houses, now incorporated into the new Palace Hotel and the Harvard, Metropolitan and University Clubs.\n\nAt the upper right of the block is Biltmore, the mansion in Asheville, N.C., designed for George Washington Vanderbilt. Completed in 1895, it is sometimes called the ''grandest castle in the land.'' The architect, Richard Morris Hunt (1828-1895), did another great Vanderbilt mansion, The Breakers in Newport, R.I., for Cornelius Vanderbilt which was also completed in 1895. The grounds for Biltmore were designed by the landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed Central Park.\n\nHunt, the first native-born American to be thoroughly trained in architecture, practiced for more than 40 years in New York City. He established himself as the most influential architect of his time in the United States. He designed the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, in 1857, a studio apartment building, considered to be one of the first, if not the first, multiple dwelling in the country.\n\nThe stamp at the lower left of the block depicts the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco built for California's Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915. The structure was formed with daring three-hinged steel arches, used only a few times before, and set on the edge of a lagoon so that it would be reflected in the water as well as silhouetted against the sky. It was such a hit with the people of San Francisco that it was the only building allowed to remain standing after the exposition closed. It was restored in 1967.\n\nBernard Maybeck (1862-1957) was the architect. In his personal life, he was a ''character,'' devoted to one fad after another, even designing his own clothes. His architecture was overwhelmingly eclectic. In one of his most famous buildings, the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Berkeley, Calif., elements of Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Japanese and Chinese architecture may be found along with touches of Swiss and American wood buildings.\n\nThe concluding stamp of the block, at the lower right, depicts one of a series of small Midwestern banks designed in his later years by Louis Henri Sullivan (1856-1924). All are admired for their form and use of ornament. The most noteworthy is the one shown, the Security Bank, formerly the National Farmers Bank, in Owatonna, Minn., built in 1908.",

Schroder defeated long-time incumbent Helmut Kohl Sunday.\n\nWith that news, the same editors, scouts, literary agents and other book people who criticized Naumann as arrogant, and mocked him for the multi-million dollar contracts he handed out to the high-browed, low-grossing likes of Thomas Pynchon and Salman Rushdie, seem willing to let bygones be bygones to hobnob with the new culture czar.\n\nThe only problem is the grandiose position Naumann aspires to was last held more than 50 years ago by Josef Goebbels.

Cromwell, a wealthy businessman who was briefly a politician and diplomat and best known in the 1930's and 40's as the husband of ''the richest girl in the world,'' Doris Duke, died of a pulmonary ailment on Monday at the Marin Terrace retirement home in Mill Valley, Calif. He was 93 years old.\n\nMr. Cromwell was connected to three of the greatest fortunes in America through two of his marriages and one of his mother's. While Jimmy, as Mr. Cromwell was known, was in his teens, his mother, Lucretia, married E. T. Stotesbury, a Philadelphia multimillionaire and banking partner of J. P. Morgan.\n\nMr. Cromwell's first marriage, in 1920, was to Delphine Dodge, the daughter of Horace T. Dodge, the automobile magnate. The two were divorced in 1928. Marriage to Doris Duke Miss Duke, who became his second wife in 1935, inherited a tobacco fortune from her father, James Buchanan Duke, the founder of Duke University.\n\nMr. Cromwell was in the public eye steadily before and during World War II while he was married to Miss Duke. Unlike the vast majority of their peers in the Social Register, they were fervent supporters of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal.\n\nIn 1933 Mr. Cromwell published a book, ''Voice of Young America,'' in which he advocated measures like guaranteed bank deposits, abandonment of the gold standard, compulsory unemployment insurance and Federally aided public works, all of which came to pass under Roosevelt.\n\nFour years later, in a treatise, ''In Defense of Capitalism,'' he shocked business leaders by advocating tight control of money by the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn 1940 Roosevelt appointed Mr. Cromwell Minister to Canada, an ambassadorship at a time when the only Ambassador to a country in the British Commonwealth was the one accredited to the Court of St. James's.\n\nA Bid for U.S. Senate\n\nMr. Cromwell resigned the post after five months to run for the United States Senate from New Jersey; he and Miss Duke lived in a mansion in Somerset County. His only bid for elective office ended in decisive defeat.\n\nThe Cromwells separated soon afterward and in 1943 became involved in acrimonious divorce proceedings that went on for five years. Miss Duke, asserting that her husband wanted a $7 million ''endowment,'' won a decree in Reno, but it was voided by a court in New Jersey. Mr. Cromwell then obtained a divorce that became final in 1948.\n\nThat year he was married for a third time, to Maxine MacFetridge, the daughter of a cement company manager. She died in 1968. In 1971 he married Germaine Benjamin, the widow of a financier. She died in 1987.\n\nMr. Cromwell was born in Manhattan, the son of Oliver Eaton Cromwell, a member of an old New York family. He went to Lawrenceville School and spent two years at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Cromwell, an athletic man, piloted racing boats, played tennis with Bill Tilden and was a talented amateur boxer, once staying three rounds with Tommy Loughran, later the world light-heavyweight champion. Mr. Cromwell served in the Marine Corps in World War I. Mr. Cromwell's Career Mr. Cromwell began his business career with Drexel & Co. in Philadelphia. While married to Miss Dodge, he started an automobile finance company, Cromwell-Dodge. In the 1950's he was involved in oil and gas production in the West and in Canada; he retired in the early 1980's.\n\nHe lived for many years in Southampton, L. I., before moving to the West Coast two years ago.\n\nMr. Cromwell is survived by a daughter from his marriage to Miss MacFetridge, Hope Hampton of Belvedere, Calif., and five grandchildren.\n\nPhoto: James H.R.

        "instruction": "STEVEN RATTNER is a Times correspondent based in London. BY STEVEN RATTNER\n\nOn one of those moist Irish mornings when the green of the rolling fields seems almost overpowering, a couple of dozen horses and riders mill around the small forecourt of a combined general store and tavern, the entirety of the commercial center of Archerstown, and spill into the single-lane crossroads, undisturbed by any automotive traffic. Onlookers in tweeds, most of whom are joining the mounted contingent in sampling the establishment's libational delights, watch as an air of excitement grows among the 50-odd hunters in outfits ranging from vivid scarlet to informal sweaters and parkas. The dozen or so pairs of equally eager hounds wait under their keeper's eye in an out-of-the way spot.\n\nAnother day of fox hunting is about to begin for the Ballymacad, the hunt whose ''country'' extends over this bit of rural Ireland, 50 miles northwest of Dublin in County Westmeath. By the end of the day, the group will have traversed perhaps 15 square miles, negotiated a variety of obstacles and chased a half-dozen foxes, all unsuccessfully but with great camaraderie.\n\nTo most Americans, ''hunting,'' as fox hunting is known in Ireland, has an aristocratic image. In places like Archerstown, a farming village of 70, it is typically Irish. Whole families hunt together on Saturdays, 6-year-olds on tiny ponies, adults often on imposing dark thoroughbreds. For Ireland, and Britain as well, the sport breaks through the divisions of religion and class that otherwise so dominate life. A typical hunting party with the Ballymacad consists of Wilsons and Mullens, farmers and airline pilots.\n\nSo for the visitor, hunting provides a rare opportunity to glimpse the life of a country from the inside. Ireland, with its narrow lanes and the least dense population in Western Europe, feels as though it were designed to be seen astride a horse. A day of hunting takes you not only off the beaten track but off the track altogether, through farms, backyards and towns so tiny they don't appear on motoring maps. From the back of a horse, the slightly burned smell that rises from the Irish earth fills the air and a fresh vibrancy permeates the scenery.\n\nHunting serves as a link to the past, a tradition that dates back centuries and still resembles a less staged version of the hunting scene in the movie ''Tom Jones.''\n\n''Look around,'' said a white-haired man named Paddy as we reached the crest of a hill. ''These fields haven't changed in 300 years.'' Hunting in Ireland, pursued with a passion unmatched in England or in Virginia, is not for the inexperienced rider. Indeed, on one recent day with the Meaths, a hunt closer to Dublin, two horses were killed, most riders were unseated at least once and we leapt ditches so wide and deep that I woke up that night dreaming of them. The day's trials, I was told later, were extraordinary, but even at easier times few things clear the mind so readily as a few hours of hunting.\n\nFor nonriders, there are several ways to reap much of the pleasure. Perhaps the most popular is to be a ''follower,'' a half-automotive, half-pedestrian pursuer. In some hunts, particularly in England, this practice has become so institutionalized that windshield stickers are sold for about $1.80 to up to 1,000 visitors.\n\n''Following'' is less organized in Ireland but can be made equally enjoyable by latching on to a semi-official following party of aides to the hunt, who care for the injured, keep watch for foxes, dig them out when necessary and even replace lost horseshoes.\n\nAs a follower, here's what you are likely to see. The whippers-in, as the guardians of the hounds (never refer to them as dogs) are called, will guide them into thickets, known as draws, that foxes are known to frequent. The whippers-in communicate with the hounds by shouted commands and by bleats on short, silver horns. The hounds respond by barking with increasing frenzy as they begin to pick up the scent of the fox.\n\nThe goal is to drive the fox out into the open, where the hunters are waiting. Then the chase begins, over hill and dale. It is something of a macho sport in which you prove yourself by pushing your horse into negotiating anything in your path as fiercely as possible as you try to keep up with the hounds and the fox. Social niceties toward other riders are reserved for the cocktail hours before and after the hunt. Alternatively, by selectively taking the long way around in an unmacho fashion, most of the arduous ditches, banks, fences and walls can be avoided.\n\nIn the rare case when the fox is caught, you have to be right on top of the hounds to see anything. The rather grisly scene can easily be avoided by keeping your distance, which is invariably my preference.\n\nA second way to participate in hunting without having to climb on a horse is by joining up with foot beagles, of which Ireland has at least 27 packs. The activity takes place without horses and with a smaller breed of hound, who runs somewhat slower. The quarry in this case is the hare.\n\nIn general, the hunting season runs from November until late March or early April, although cub hunting, which trains newcomers both two-legged and four-legged, begins in August or September. The 85 Irish hunts go out on different days and only a few meet on Sundays. The Irish Times, Dublin's principal morning newspaper, lists where hunts in the capital area will be meeting. For hunts elsewhere, the Irish Tourist Board can provide names and telephone numbers.\n\nIf you want to ride, the members of most hunts will rent you a horse for the day, usually for $30 to $45. In addition, you will have to pay the hunt a visitors' fee of $15 to $45. Some hunts are fairly strict about proper hunting attire, which can often be borrowed or rented, while others impose few requirements.\n\nAt the end of the day, often in darkness some five hours after the opening glass of port, the participants will disperse, sometimes gathering at a local pub to sit by the fire, sip whisky and reminisce of great hunts past. By this point, if you've proven yourself, you'll feel as Irish as an O'Reilly.",

        "instruction": "\"A soldier's letter,\" dated Fort Esperanza, Texas; Dec. 3, gives the following account of the capture of that place:\n\n\"On the 22d we crossed Orange Bay, landed on St. Joseph Island, and next morning took our line of march without baggage or transportation. We managed to each carry one or two blankets and three days' rations. We moved eighteen miles and arrived about sundown at Cedar Bayou, a stream about 100 yards in width, which divides St. Joseph and Matagorda Islands. We were here nearly two days in crossing this stream.\n\nWhile crossing this bayou, some of us who were not engaged in the work went out hunting deer, and were fortunate enough to kill not less than two dozen; and quite a number of choice beeves, all of which were well relished by hungry officers and soldiers.\n\nThe last of our troops gained Matagorda Island about 11 o'clock at night, marched up the beach eight miles, and camped until morning. Next day we marched twenty-five miles, which brought us within ten miles of this place.\n\nThe following morning, the 27th, we were up early as usual, and expected by noon or before to have a big fight, as from all information we had been able to obtain, we expected a warm reception. But such was not the result. Our fight did not amount to much. We drove in their pickets, and found that they had a strong fort and eight, heavy guns mounted thereon. In a skirmish, driving in their pickets, we had one of our staff wounded severely, and one man slightly in the shoulder. We then withdrew and encamped for the night. The next day we did nothing, in consequence of being visited by what the citizens here call a norther. The cold was intense. Never suffered more from cold in my life -- from the fact that the wind was severe, and our command had neither tents nor wood, and were lying on the cold, sandy beach, the sand nearly filling every eye. But the cold finally proved beneficial, from the fact that it pinched rebels worse than ourselves, and by being constantly on the alert, we caught them unexpectedly and gained their outer works, consisting of a fine line of intrenchments, about six hundred yards in advance of their fort. These works we took early on the 29th, and got several nieces of artillery in position that evening, under a fire from their heavy guns on the fort, but with little damage to us. When we had gained this advantage, the rebels became somewhat uneasy. As the wind began to lull, and six or seven gunboats lay within sight, waiting for a calm, to come up in range, about 10 o'clock P.M., they began preparing to evacuate, and by 1 A.M. we were aroused by the explosion of one of the magazines, of which there were seven in the fort. We believing the explosion no humbug, ordered our skirmishers forward, and found the fort evacuated and the inside all in flames. We captured six prisoners that were left behind to do the firing. We entered and saved two of the magazines and considerable ammunition, but the other five were blown up. We pursued the rebels to a bayou, which is about one and a half miles further up the island, where they had a ferry, and the boat on the other side, but after daylight we succeeded in crossing a few men, and captured a small fort on the other island, with one 24-pound siege gun, making in all eight guns, and a 10-inch columbiad, the rest are all 24-pound siege guns. This gives us the best harbor on the Texas coast, and the key to Galveston by way of Matagorda and Houston. Thus far we have succeeded to our most sanguine hopes. Our loss in taking this place was one man killed and ten wounded, all privates, except Lieut. G.H. FIFER, of the Twenty-third Illinois, who was Aid-de-Camp First brigade, First division, Thirteenth army corps. No other troops participated in the fight. Our forces here, until after the reduction of the fort, numbered about three thousand, (with eight field pieces,) viz.: The First brigade, First division, Thirteenth army corps, commanded by H.D. WASHBURNE, Colonel Forty-eighth Indiana infantry, and the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Maine, and Thirty-fourth Iowa, commanded by Brigadier-Gen. RANSOM, the whole commanded by Major-Gen. C.C. WASHBURNE. But I must boast a little for the First Brigade, commonly known as Benton's brigade, but commanded now by Col. WASHBURNE, Gen. BENTON being absent. Our brigade is composed of the following regiments, viz: Eighth Indiana infantry, Ninety-ninth Illinois infantry and Thirty-third Illinois infantry. These regiments have all been tried on many bloody fields, and have never failed to come out victorious, and the rebels have frequently expressed an unwillingness to fight us, for, as they say, we never have been whipped, and it is no use to try to whip us.\"",

Since 2003, it has bought about 40 companies, and it made some of its most expensive deals in 2012, including the $300 million purchase of Transcend Services Inc., an Atlanta medical documents company.\n\nIts acquisition activity has taken a toll on the company’s profit margins in years past, but many investment analysts say Nuance could be the prime benefactor if speech technology really takes hold. In fact, the company attracted the interest of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who bought a 9.3 percent stake in April. “Understanding language is one step.

But he said that as it improves, “language is going to be the ideal way to interface with devices.”\n\nThe company is redoubling research and development efforts. It will open a new engineering center this summer in Cambridge, adding to a group of speech technology experts it acquired when Nuance bought Vlingo Corp., a local start-up, last year for $200 million.\n\nThe biggest question facing Nuance is whether more people than just early tech adopters really want a talking virtual assistant inside their wristwatches or smartphones.\n\n“Over time, there are talks of adding sentiment to voice technology so that your device will recognize what mood you are in,” said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst at Gartner Inc. “As geeky as it might sound, I am sure advertisers will be happy to know when the best moment is to sell you something.”",

SPG 1.33 % boosted its outlook for the year, but analysts were expecting the retail real-estate operator to paint an even rosier earnings forecast.\n\nThe company also said Wednesday that profit and revenue declined in its latest period amid lower tourist spending. Shares fell 1.2% to $221.75 in recent trading in New York.\n\nSimon lifted its 2016 earnings forecast to a range of $6.04 to $6.12 from its April guidance, well below the $6.26 a share projected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nOn a conference call, David E. Simon, the company’s chief executive, said retail sales at some of its more tourist-oriented malls and outlets have been hurt by a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nSimon’s total sales per square foot were $607 at the end of the June quarter, down from $620 a year earlier. Mr. Simon said sales per square foot were down “due to a retailer and a state with no sales tax, implementing sales restrictions.”\n\nFunds from operations, a closely watched profitability measure for real-estate investment trusts, was flat at $2.63. But the company said that excluding 22 cents a share related to a gain from the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the prior-year quarter, funds from operations grew 9.1% in the latest period. The company now sees funds from operations between $10.77 to $10.85, compared with prior guidance of $10.72 to $10.82 a share.\n\nThe company’s occupancy and sales-per-foot rates have generally improved since 2014, when it spun off its strip centers and smaller enclosed malls into an independent, publicly traded trust. Occupancy at Simon’s U.S. malls at the end of June was 95.9%, compared with 96.1% a year earlier. Meanwhile, base minimum rent per square foot rose to $50.43 from $48.07 in the year-earlier period.\n\nOver all, Simon Property Group reported profit of $455.4 million, or $1.45 a share, compared with $472.9 million, or $1.52 a share, in the year-prior period. The gain from the marketable securities sale also makes for an unfavorable comparison to the prior quarter.\n\nRevenue fell 2.5% to $1.32 billion.

        "instruction": "By Jason Notte The Street\n\nCraft beer geeks and mainstream beer drinkers usually don't mix, but summer has a way of getting everybody to the same bar.\n\nBy necessity, beer drinkers tend to shift to lighter, more refreshing brews as temperatures rise. They also tend to drink a lot more of it than at any other time of the year. The Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's statistics show that brewers produced roughly 17 million barrels last May and 18 million barrels a month from June through August. That's well up from the 14 million to 15 million a month they generally crank out during the rest of the year.\n\nConsidering that uptick in volume, is there any way to buy beer during the summer without breaking the bank or sipping swill? With help from folks at multistate wine and beer sellers Total Wine and reviewers at RateBeer and Beer Advocate, we priced out 10 of the summer's best beer offerings that won't break your budget. Price may vary by location, but these widely available brews won't:\n\nPrice per six-pack: $6.99 BeerAdvocate rating: 3.38 out of 5 Rate Beer rating: 2.91 out of 5\n\nThat cloudy haze in your glass, coriander scent before and citrus flavor with each sip are all trademarks of witbier, a Belgian style that Americans have come to know as wheat beer. There's going to be a lot more of it on this list, but Leinenkugel's deserves special attention for its bittersweet flavor and sweet price. Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing has been owned by Miller since 1988, and that size and distribution range comes with certain advantages.\n\nPrice per six-pack: $6.99 BeerAdvocate rating: 3.39 out of 5 Rate Beer rating: 2.95 out of 5\n\nCitrus tends to be the one element that binds summer beers, and Sam Summer is full of it. Boston Beer will blather on about the \"Grains of Paradise\" that spice up this brew, but it's the lemon zest that really comes through and gives the Summer Ale its distinct flavor. But how does a craft brewer push out a beer for the same price as a macro? Boston Beer's no average craft brewer: It has three breweries and poured out nearly 2.5 million barrels last year. The next closest craft brewer, Sierra Nevada, didn't top 1 million.\n\nPrice per six-pack: $6.99 BeerAdvocate rating: 3.42 out of 5 Rate Beer rating: 2.99 out of 5\n\nMolsonCoors doesn't go out of its way to tell folks Blue Moon is a Coors product, but craft beer fans don't go out of their way to dis it once they find out. Born in a brewpub at Coors Field in Denver, Blue Moon is a creamy, citrusy dream of a witbier that became the everyman's Belgian beer shortly after it was introduced in 1995. It's relatively inexpensive, it's refreshing and it's a great gateway to other, more complex brews. It's just too bad Coors doesn't offer many more beyond its Blue Moon line.\n\nPrice per six-pack: $6.49 BeerAdvocate rating: 3.05 out of 5 Rate Beer rating: 2.59 out of 5\n\nThe geeks are a bit less kind to Shock Top's witbier, but the fact that it's Budweiser's unofficial witbier may have something to do with that. Shock Top is an Anheuser-Busch InBev product and is oft treated as such by those in the know. Those who hadn't reached that realization, however, should know that A-B InBev isn't exactly a bumbling stooge when it comes to making witbier. The company's stable of beers also includes Hoegaarden, the beer Pierre Celis used to shake the witbier style out of centuries of slumber in 1965. It's slightly more expensive, which gives Shock Top the upper hand when fighting its way onto porch parties and into beer coolers this summer.\n\nPrice per six-pack: $7.99 BeerAdvocate rating: 3.68 out of 5 Rate Beer rating: 3.26 out of 5\n\nOnce a beer gets above $8 a six-pack, it's tough to call it inexpensive. Widmer toes that line, but gives drinkers a whole lot of value for that extra buck. The \"Citra\" in the name comes from citra hops, which imbue beer with a citrusy flavor that has a lot more bite than the standard witbier. Beer fans who fear the IPA shouldn't worry, as this blonde is far less bitter than its distant, hopheaded cousin. At 4.3 percent alchohol by volume, it's also a lot more drinkable on a warm day. P.S. Thank Anheuser-Busch Inbev for keeping the price even that low, as its 36 percent ownership of Widmer's Craft Brewers Alliance and distribution deal with that group makes this beer available readily in most markets.\n\nMore From The Street --The 10 Priciest Beers in Baseball --The 10 Most Expensive Trips to Ballgames in 2012 --The 10 Greatest Ballparks for Foodies --The 10 Cheapest Sports Cars of 2012\n\nPopular Stories On ThePostGame: -- The World's Best Beers -- Baseball-Themed Brews -- Pint Of Beer A Day Keeps Heart Disease Away -- Beer As Performance Enhancer?",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, May 13— To those standing at news tickers, w atching in dismay urgent dispatches about the shooting of the Pope, t he most chilling moment came with the normal process of news c overage: ''For release only on Confirmation of Death'' was the top l ine, followed by the customary prepared obituary.\n\nAs that was being transmitted, other machines thumped and clacked more reassuring news that the wounds did not appear to be mortal and that Vatican hospital authorities no longer used the word ''grave'' to describe the condition of their patient.\n\nIn the aftermath, we should recognize that in non-police states, presidents, popes and pop stars face a worldwide epidemic of assassination.\n\nWhether the work of madmen or terrorists, each attempt generates the publicity that gives the idea to others. What can be done to reduce the danger to the celebrated without appearing to quaver before the demented? How can political and spiritual leaders press the flesh without pressing their luck too far?\n\nOne good answer is in a memo now being circulated at the White House and Secret Service. The author is Richard Moore, a Washington attorney who was a campaign adviser to George Bush and a longtime aide to Richard Nixon.\n\nIn his memo, Mr. Moore recalls Mr. Nixon's words as the news was flashed that an attempt had been made on the life of President Ford: ''He was probably in a crowd where the assassin knew in advance that he would be com-ing.'' Sure enough, the attempt had been made as Mr. Ford was en route from his hotel to an announced destination.\n\nMr. Moore asks what the following events have in common: the killing of Robert Kennedy coming out of a hotel; the crippling of George Wallace as he walked toward his car after a scheduled speaking appearance in a shopping center; the two attempts on President Ford's life as he was leaving speaking engagements; the shooting of President Reagan as he walked from a hotel to his car after a scheduled appearance.\n\n''The perilous moments,'' writes the man who has accompanied campaigners on thousands of events, ''do not occur at a public event ... they occur on the fringe of public events, the demonstrated 'deadly fringe' - entering and leaving the event itself.''\n\nThe shooting of the Pope took place as he was moving through the crowd on his way to a general audience. Although the slow progress of the ''popemobile'' is like an open-car parade, the pattern holds: the most vulnerable moment is not at an event, but on the way to and from, especially when the route is known.\n\n''I did that sort of thing myself,'' Mr. Moore quotes Mr. Nixon, ''although I usually tried to do it on a surprise basis. That is when you are safest. I do think the time has come for a President to avoid getting too close to a crowd when some potential assassin with a gun knows that the President is going to be there.''\n\nLeaders are rarely attacked while addressing multitudes. Not once in this century has anyone attempted to assassinate a President or Presidential candidate making a speech in an enclosed area such as an auditorium or convention hall. The target is far away; a handgun is inaccurate; a gunman is likely to be jostled, as happened in the attempt on President-elect Roosevelt in 1933. Few nuts are expert marksmen; most need to get in close.\n\nHere is how leaders can stay ''close to the people'' without unnecessarily endangering their lives: First, they should eliminate the ''deadly fringe'' surrounding scheduled events. Drive up on the sidewalk and park laterally flush against stage doors, or go through secured underground garages, or use unlikely entrances and exits.\n\nSecond, forget open cars. Leaders should use the ''Eisenhower bubble-top'' if they want to see and be seen on parade. And the bulletproof vest is a must: for a priest, taking care shows no lack of faith, and for a politician, being prudent shows no lack of courage.\n\nFinally, they should use the element of surprise. Working the fence at a scheduled airport rally is highly dangerous; stopping at random along an unannounced route and plunging into a crowd is quite safe. The pictures of human contact are the same, but, as Mr. Moore writes, ''the odds against an assassin finding himself standing next to a President are many millions to one.'' the answer to this generation's assassination epidemic is not for leaders to isolate themselves; the answer is for them to reduce their risk. When not even the safety of the Pope is sacred, leaders everywhere are obliged to avoid the deadly fringe and to employ the element of surprise.",

He was host of a recent public television series, ''From Jumpstreet,'' a history of black music. He wrote the music, lyrics and book for the musical version of ''Big Time Buck White'' and acted in it.\n\nTonight, and tomorrow night, Oscar Brown Jr. will be the bill at the West Bank Cafe, downstairs in its cabaret. It is a one-man show, but appearing with him will be his son, Oscar Brown 3d, and Calvin Brunson. The West Bank is at 407 West 42d Street, a few steps west of Ninth Avenue. Admission: $7.

''Cahiers du Cinema'' regarded as it the ''first film of the American new wave.'' Tonight, in the Center for Public Cinema's Independent Showcase series, ''The Foreigner,'' by Mr. Poe will be shown at the Bleecker Street Cinema, at 10:30 o'clock. This 90-minute film, stars Eric Mitchell, Patti Astor and Deborah Harry.\n\nMr. Poe will introduce the film and also answer questions about it. The Bleecker Street Cinema is at 144 Bleecker Street. For confirmation of the schedule: 674-2560. In temporal contrast, two films by Orson Welles, starring Orson Welles, will be shown tonight at Theater 80, at 80 St. Marks Place.

Robinson, Richard Long and Philip Merivale may be seen at 3, 5:55 and 8:50 P.M.\n\n''Journey Into Fear,'' a 1942 spy story with Joseph Cotten, Dolores Del Rio, Ruth Warwick and Agnes Moorhead goes on at 4:40, 7:35 and 10:30 P.M. Admission: $4. Information: 254-7400. QUIET NIGHT\n\nThis is the first time, Wilfred A. Hunt said, that a play has been presented exclusively in mime in this country. There is no narration, no dialogue in ''The Fox,'' by D.H. Lawrence, which has been adapted for mime by Mr. Hunt and Billie Lorant. The result is a full length mime drama featuring Mr. Hunt, Miss Lorant and Lisa Loving.\n\nThe performers use mime as a dramatic art form, rather than to create illusions. With pure, simple style they focus on the essence of their characters and the characters' needs and desires. ''By combining this focus,'' said Mr. Hunt, ''with the philosophy of 'one movement for each idea,' the performers dramatically transpose to the stage the search for happiness which Mr. Lawrence wrote of in his novel.''\n\nThe search for happiness is portrayed by the cast of three through the friendship of the two women and the destuction of that friendship and their lives by the man.

        "instruction": "''That was a cheap shot,'' said William French Smith, the recently appointed Attorney General, responding to criticism about his attendance at a party for a well-known friend of mobsters.\n\n''Cheap shot'' is a locution of recent vintage. Stuart Berg Flexner, the slang authority, suspects it may have originated in boxing, but his first printed citation, in Business Week in 1971, is about a football player: ''Like most cornerbacks, (Lemar) Parrish is a master of the cheap shot.'' In football, a cheap shot is a tackle or block delivered when the player on the receiving end is unable to defend himself - stretching to catch a pass, for example, or being wrestled down by another player.\n\nThe phrase was used in its political sense a year later, again in Business Week, in criticism of ''A Populist Manifesto,'' by Jack Newfield and Jeff Greenfield. The critic wrote of ''Gene McCarthy, for whom they reserve most of their cheap shots.'' The term was picked up by a political reporter in 1976, who asked candidate Jimmy Carter whether he thought a certain barb aimed at President Ford did not constitute such a cheap shot. Mr. Carter replied: ''I don't think it was a cheap shot,'' thus immortalizing the phrase.\n\nMr. French Smith, not content with the football metaphor, turned to a word long held in favor by denouncers of media attacks: ''scurrilous.'' The Washington Post reported: ''He labeled news reports questioning the propriety of his appearance at the birthday party as 'nothing less than scurrilous,' repeating the word 'scurrilous' three times, until he finally added, 'Am I making myself clear?' ''\n\nTo aid our new top lawman in his quest for clarity: The most common definition of ''scurrilous'' is ''obscene, vulgar, coarse,'' but that cannot be what he meant. Politicians who use the vogue phrase ''scurrilous attack'' intend the adjective to mean ''low, mean,'' or, if the politician attacked is more literate, ''abusive, vituperative.'' The etymology is from the Latin scurra , buffoon - a jester who presumably told dirty jokes.\n\nOne of the scurrilous cheap-shooters, aghast and nonp@lussed at the French Smith counterattack, whimpered in print that a man in the position of Attorney General ''must start acting immediately like Caeser's wife.''\n\nThat displayed an ignorance of Plutarch even more profound than French Smith's lack of understanding of the requirements of his office. Caesar's wife was Pompeia, who - while participating in a religious ceremony open only to women - was said to have entertained a man named Clodius, her lover. The scandal of sacrilege shook Rome; Clodius escaped conviction in a trial, but Caesar divorced Pompeia, saying ''Caesar's wife must be above suspicion.'' Thus, ''like Caesar's wife'' does not mean ''above suspicion,'' unless the speaker is artfully referring to Caesar's next wife, Calpurnia, who knew enough to stay away from orgies with the buddies of Roman gangsters.\n\nLet me not mislead readers: One of the obscene vituperators who offended Mr. French Smith was me. The last time I was denounced as ''scurrilous'' was during the Kissinger Administration, when a spokesman at the State Department went on to condemn my ''contemptuous behavior.'' Asked if he did not mean ''contemptible,'' the spokesman recovered quickly with ''That, too.'' To mention his name now would be a cheap shot.\n\nThe preceding paragraph's lead sentence ended with ''was me.'' Before firing off a scurrilous postcard, read on.\n\n''Why do I protect the source,'' I wondered aloud in a political column, ''when it was me?'' A great many readers felt called upon to protect the source of our communication - namely, the English language, which traditionally calls for a subjective pronoun (I, we, he, she, they, who) whenever the word is joined to the subject by a linking verb. Thus, by all that used to be correct in grammar, I should have written ''when it was I.'' Similarly, the old correctness called for the subjective ''That is he,'' not the objective ''That is him.''\n\nBut in this case, the old correctness has become the new error of pedantry. Nobody picks a suspect out of lineup with a shouted ''That's he!'' In the real world, ''That is him'' or ''That is her'' is the preferred form. It's time we stopped differentiating between spoken and written English on such pronouns: I don't like the idea of claiming ''It is I'' is right for writing and ''It is me'' is acceptable for speaking. The colloquial form has taken over.\n\nThe subjective form (I, they) should be used only when the word looks and sounds like the subject. But when it looks like the object (as in ''It's them''), use the objective (me, them). If anybody demands to know who told you to do this horrible deed, tell them it was me.\n\nCorrespondent Henry Stanley, the African explorer of a century ago, was abused here more squarely than roundly for saying ''Dr. Livingstone, I presume?'' when I thought he should have said ''assume.''\n\nI have always used ''presume'' to mean ''to go too far,'' or to take for granted in an unwarranted way. But I am now informed that ''presume'' can also be synonymous with ''assume,'' as in ''the presumption of innocence.'' When used in this meaning, ''presume'' is slighty more emphatic than ''assume.'' (I presume my readers understand this; I assume other people may.)\n\nRobert Machol, who presumes to instruct us in this matter, reads these words in The International Herald Tribune; from somewhere in Europe, he passes on this conundrum: ''What is the question to which 'Dr. Livingston, I presume' is the answer?'' The question: ''Dr. Presume, what are your first name and middle initial?''\n\nThe only thing more embarrassing than to make a usage mistake in a language column is to correct somebody else's mistake - and to turn out to be wrong.\n\nLinda Rawson was quoted here as ''shocked'' to see the word ''nifty'' in The Wall Street Journal, and suggested that I come up with ''an alternative word.'' With no little patronization, I observed, ''She meant to write 'alternate word' or 'alternative.' ''\n\nZap! The Assistant Page One Editor of The Wall Street Journal, Mack B. Solomon, springs to her defense: ''I think the lady wrote exactly what she meant.'' He and she are right: ''Alternative'' as an adjective means ''presenting a second thing or proposition for choice,'' while ''alternate'' as an adjective means ''occurring by turns,'' as ''on alternate days.''\n\nMr. Solomon, whose title might better be Page One Assistant Editor, concludes: ''In short, even if Linda Rawson doesn't like our use of 'nifty,' I like her use of 'alternative.' As to 'alternate' and 'alternative,' I think there's a nice (if not nifty) distinction.'' end",

''Cheap shot'' is a locution of recent vintage. Stuart Berg Flexner, the slang authority, suspects it may have originated in boxing, but his first printed citation, in Business Week in 1971, is about a football player: ''Like most cornerbacks, (Lemar) Parrish is a master of the cheap shot.'' In football, a cheap shot is a tackle or block delivered when the player on the receiving end is unable to defend himself - stretching to catch a pass, for example, or being wrestled down by another player."

On the flip side, just 27 percent of people refinancing their homes pulled cash out, which is the lowest number on record.\n\nabout the cash-in trend, the\n\ncalled it \"the post-boom, post-crash trend that's really hot.\" The cash-in vogue seems to be on the rise as well, increasing from about 13% of refinancings in early 2009 to 33% in the final three months. In a regional breakdown, Freddie Mac found the Midwest had the largest share of cash-in refinancing.\n\nThese days, a home loan may be the best place for people to stash some of their cash -- if they have any -- what with many investments languishing, and interest and CD rates remaining painfully low. For those whose homes have lost significant value, refinancing may be the only way they can take advantage of low loan rates, which are expected to rise later this year.\n\n\"Homeowners who can't refinance because their mortgage rates are 'under water' should seriously consider using savings to pay the mortgage balance down enough to qualify for refinancing,\" Richard Barrington, a consultant for Moneyrates.com, told WalletPop.\n\nFreddie Mac, which bases its survey on a sample of properties where it has funded at least two loans in a row, said the results fit in with other economic indications that people are looking for ways to trim back their monthly overhead. For the unemployed and those who've taken financial hits from furloughs and wage reductions, cutting day-to-day expenses often takes precedence over maintaining longer-term savings.\n\n\"This transformation from a cash-out refi market to a cash-in refi market is consistent with other data we've seen on households reducing their overall debt burdens, particularly revolving credit like credit cards,\" Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, said in a\n\n. \"From September of 2008 to November of 2009, consumers cut $100 billion dollars in revolving debt from their obligations, according to the Federal Reserve Board.\"\n\nStill, not everyone is with the program.

It has paralyzed the country and left it without a president.\n\nLebanon's worst internal strife since the 1975-90 civil war erupted this week after the government decided to dismantle Hezbollah's military communications network. The group said the government had declared war.\n\nIn scenes reminiscent of the civil war, men with rifles roamed the streets amid smashed cars and smoldering buildings.\n\nFighting died down as outgunned government supporters, many of them supporters of Sunni leader Saad al-Hariri, handed over their weapons and offices to the army, which has tried to remain neutral in the conflict.\n\nThe anti-Syria ruling coalition said the \"armed and bloody coup\" was aimed at increasing Iran's influence and restoring that of Syria, forced to withdraw troops from Lebanon in 2005.\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesman said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had phoned her French and Saudi counterparts and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to discuss \"what the international system can do to support this Lebanese government ... in the face of illegal acts, by the armed gangs\".\n\n\"The linkages that we know exist, and are ongoing, between Hezbollah and Syria and Iran, are starting to manifest themselves in the current crisis,\" he said.\n\n\"We are seeing now some evidence of those groups that are linked to Syria ... taking a much more active role in fanning the flames of the violence.\"\n\nA White House spokesman said: \"The United States is consulting with other governments in the region and with the U.N. Security Council about measures that must be taken to hold those responsible for the violence in Beirut accountable.\"\n\nSyria said the issue was an internal Lebanese affair, while Iran blamed \"the adventurist interferences\" of the United States and Israel for the violence.\n\nA senior opposition source told Reuters that Hezbollah and its allies would maintain roadblocks, including barricades on routes to the airport, until a full resolution of the crisis.\n\n\"All issues are linked. Beirut will remain shut until there is a political solution,\" the source said.\n\nAn influential pro-government leader called for dialogue.\n\nWalid Jumblatt, leader of the Druze minority, said Hezbollah \"regardless of its military strength, cannot annul the other\".\n\nThe dead included a woman and her 30-year-old son, killed while trying to flee Ras al-Nabae -- a mixed Sunni-Shi'ite Beirut district and scene of some of the heaviest clashes.\n\n\"They were trying to flee to the mountains. Instead ... they reached the hospital, dead,\" said a relative, who declined to give her name out of fear for her own safety.\n\n\"It was terrifying during the night. We couldn't even move about in the house,\" said another woman, a Ras al-Nabae resident who fled the area at first light with her children. \"We spent the night in the corridor.\"\n\nHezbollah seized the offices of pro-government factions, including Hariri's Future group in the predominantly Muslim western half of the city.\n\nBacked by gunmen from the Shi'ite Amal group, Hezbollah handed over the offices to the army. Hariri supporters gave up their offices to the army elsewhere in the country.\n\nHezbollah also moved into Hariri-owned media outlets, and Hariri's television and radio stations went off the air. Opposition gunmen of the Syrian Socialist National Party set ablaze a building housing studios of Hariri's TV station.\n\n\"It certainly leaves the government weaker and the Future movement weaker,\" said Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.\n\nBut Hezbollah does not want to be seen as an \"occupier of Beirut\", he said, and handing control to the army appeared its most likely exit.\n\nThe European Union, Germany and France urged a peaceful resolution. Syria said the issue was an internal Lebanese affair while Iran blamed the United States and Israel for the violence.\n\nHezbollah was the only Lebanese faction allowed to keep its weapons after the civil war to fight Israeli forces occupying the south. Israel withdrew in 2000 and the fate of Hezbollah's weapons is at the heart of the political crisis.\n\n(Additional reporting by Nadim Ladki and Laila Bassam; editing by Andrew Roche)",

        "instruction": "About 24 years ago, just a few months after her first birthday, a little girl with tight brown curls named Mari a Ruiz became the responsibility of the State of New York.\n\nShe went to live in a big brick building in the complex on Staten Island then called Willowbrook, and every Sunday her mother and father took a bus, a ferry and two more buses on the other side of the bay to visit her in a drab little waiting room. She was profoundly retarded, and rigid and ungainly from cerebral palsy, but she smiled a lot.\n\nHer parents never visited the ward in which she lived and slept. Her mother, Leovarda, who had the same curly hair, sometimes had nightmares about her daughter, but she could not say exactly what they were or what they meant.\n\nThis month, after spending almost her entire life in institutions, Maria will be put into a van in her wheelchair and driven to her parents' home in the Bronx to live with Wilfredo and Leovarda Ruiz, who bore her but did not know what to do wi th her when she was a babyand they were young.\n\nMaria has not changed very much since her parents decided to institutionalize her so many years ago, but the world in which she has not lived has changed a great deal. There was a great outcry about Willowbrook in particular and institutions in general; there were doctors who decided that retarded children would grow best with their parents, and parents who decided that, too.\n\nAnd there is Maria, who is going home because of all those things, and because, at base, her parents never really stopped feeling that they had done something terribly wrong when they listened to the doctors and sent their firstborn away.\n\n''We always think about this because we do not want to put her in,'' said Mrs. Ruiz, sitting knees to knees with her rag doll of a daughter and running her hands up and down the short calves in their pink knee socks. ''I went to the doctor when she was four months, and I asked the doctor why she put her head to the back like that and why she does not have the movement of a child that age. The doctor told me she was lazy.\n\n''But then at seven months we take her to St. Vincent's, and then they find out that she is brain-damaged. The doctor told me that the best thing was to send her to Willowbrook. We don't want to send her over there, but then I get pregnant with my son and I can't have two children like that.'' And she folded her arms like a mother holding an infant.\n\nMrs. Ruiz's son grew up to become an electrical engineer, and her daughter grew up to be a baby, for while Maria's body has traveled through adolescence into adulthood, she wears the clothes of a small child - pink dress with lace collar, black Mary Janes, socks, diapers -and her mind has remained just about where it was when her parents took her to the doctors at St. Vincent's. She recognizes her mother, and she bounces up and down in her wheelchair when music is on the stereo, but she cannot walk or wash herself. She has learned one word in her life: ''Papa.''\n\nMaria might have lived and died in an institution if the parents of some Willowbrook patients had not brought a class-action suit charging that the facility was overcrowded and inadequately staffed. In 1975, a Federal judge gave the state six years to change conditions, and one of the changes was Maria. She was moved into something called a Post Institutional Placement Program run by United Cerebral Palsy of New York State.\n\nFor the last year, in response to the judicial decision that mandated life for her and others like her ''in the community at large,'' she has lived in an apartment managed by the organization in a big old prewar building on the Upper West Side, going every day to a school where she is trained to groom and feed herself. On the bureau in her bedroom there is a baby picture: bright eyes, sturdy little shoulders, a dark spit curl rising above the low forehead, a Gerber baby of a little girl.\n\nMrs. Ruiz put it there. She is always with her daughter now that it is possible, now that her guilt has been tempered by time and change. Mrs. Ruiz sometimes takes Maria home for the weekends. The neighbors in the Ruizes' Bronx apartment building hover around as though Leovarda was bringing a new baby home from the hospital. Maria twists her head and smiles.\n\n''You have to wonder,'' said Toby Kleinhandler, who once worked at Willowbrook and is now associate director of the Post Institutional Placement Program, ''what would have happened if she had had this kind of life early on.''\n\nSince Maria has been living in the apartment, she has had many small victories. She makes eye contact with strangers, can feed herself with a special spoon and bowl and accepts hugs and praise as rewards now, rather than food. Her parents decided that they wanted to take her home. They were interviewed and questioned and assessed and evaluated.\n\nWillowbrook was once the ''providing agency'' for Maria's care. Now her parents become the providers, although primary responsibility for their daughter wi ll stay with the state, whic h can provide services and care Mr. and Mrs. Ruiz cannot. The parent s are not opposed to entering into such a partnership; they are wo rking people in their early 50's, and while their daughter is an in fant in so many ways, her body is strong and she may outlive them.\n\n''Now I can sleep very well with her in my house,'' Mrs. Ruiz said. ''Because sometimes before, I go to bed and I picture things. Too many things have happened.''\n\n''I need only some other person to take her from the bath to here,'' she said, laying one hand on the padded arm of the wheelchair. Then she blew her daughter a noisy kiss. Maria raised her head from her chest with some difficulty and smiled the smile of the perfectly innocent.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Leovarda Ruiz with daughter, Maria",

And credits for adopting a child and for college expenses continue.\n\nBut several deductions, credits, and other provisions will end.\n\nThe alternative minimum tax exemptions will drop to pre-2001 levels if Congress doesn’t act. If history is any guide, however, Congress will act.\n\nSimilarly, without congressional action people over 70½ will no longer be able to make tax-free withdrawals from IRAs for charitable contributions, and teachers won’t be able to take a $250 deduction for classroom supplies bought with their own money.\n\n“There are a lot of open question marks,’’ IRS spokesman Terry Lemons said.\n\nThe IRS recommends reviewing your withholding to make sure it is in line with what your tax liability is likely to be. There’s a calculator at irs.gov. By having less withheld, people can get their money upfront, rather than wait for a refund.\n\nSome tax law provisions still in effect for 2012:\n\n- The Bush tax cuts, which set marginal income tax rates of 10, 15, 25, 28, 33, and 35 percent. These rates will increase beginning in 2013 unless Congress decides otherwise.\n\n- Capital gains tax rates of 0 percent and 15 percent. Capital gains generally are the increase in the value of an asset, such as stock or a home, from time of purchase until sale. Net long-term capital gains - on assets held more than a year - are taxed at the 0 or 15 percent. Net gains on assets held less than a year - short-term gains - are taxed at regular income tax rates.\n\n- The child tax credit of $1,000 per child. It drops to $500 in 2013 unless Congress acts.\n\n- The higher earned income tax credit for families with three or more children. After 2012, such families will be treated the same as those with two children if Congress doesn’t pass an extension.\n\n- The credit for expenses associated with adoption. However, the adoption credit is no longer refundable and is limited to $12,650 in 2012. It phases out for people with higher incomes.\n\n- The American Opportunity Credit, which allows a maximum credit of $2,500 for tuition and other expenses for each of the first four years of higher education. It also phases out at higher incomes, and is partially refundable.\n\n- A patch for the alternative minimum tax. Absent congressional action, the exemption will drop to $45,000 for married couples filing jointly, $33,750 for single person, and $22,500 for married people filing separately.\n\n- The deduction for qualified tuition and fees.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON — We have become a nation charmed by offers that something might be free. Especially when it comes to credit.\n\nLet’s look at the offers many consumers will receive as they shop for the holidays. Professionals call these promotions “deferred interest plans.” But more commonly the advertising may say something like “No interest for 18 months” or “0 percent interest for 12 months.”\n\nThis is credit with a catch. And if you are caught, it’s expensive.\n\nThe no-interest deals involve getting a credit card on which your purchases will be charged. During the promotional period, interest is accruing but you won’t be charged if the balance is paid in full by the deadline. Don’t meet that benchmark and you could have to pay all of the deferred interest.\n\nFor borrowers with subprime credit scores — the most vulnerable to such offers — 43 percent are ultimately charged retroactive interest, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nCardHub, a credit card comparison website, has issued a report about the trickiest deferred finance offers. The site says that of the major retailers that provide financing, 50 percent currently offer a deferred interest plan.\n\nIf you’re going to use a deferred interest plan, here are some things you should be aware of, according to the CFPB:\n\n■ Know when you owe. The credit card company has to be clear about the date by which you must pay off your balance to avoid being charged deferred interest. The information should appear on the front page of your bill. It has to be disclosed separately during the deferred interest period and labeled in a way to make it clear it’s your deferred interest charge.\n\n■ Read the fine print or card terms carefully because if you pay late or leave an unpaid balance of even just $1 at the end of the promotion period, interest will be retroactively applied to your entire original purchase amount, CardHub points out.\n\nIn its report, CardHub said 29 percent of the retailers that offer a deferred interest plan scored very low on the transparency scale because they bury information in the fine print or in footnotes. CardHub found that 53 percent of retailers with deferred interest promotions also offer consumers discounts that may be better than signing up for financing. The average discount is 16 percent.\n\nThe point is you may be better off utilizing a holiday discount and avoiding signing up for the credit card, which by the way could make your credit score go down.\n\nBut if you’re going to use a deferred interest plan, here are some other things you should also be aware of, according to the CFPB:\n\n■ Know what you owe. Pay attention to the interest rate because life happens. And if there’s a chance you can’t pay off the balance in time, that’s the rate you’re stuck with.\n\nIn CardHub’s report, rates varied, with most carrying rates of 20 percent or more. The highest rate was 29.99 percent. As of Nov. 20, the average annual percentage rate for fixed-rate credit cards was 13.02 percent, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nRates are often significantly higher for deferred interest programs than for other cards. So don’t be so overconfident about your ability to pay that you ignore the interest you will be charged.\n\n■ Know your payment options. You may wait until you get near the end of the promotion to pay off the balance or you may make payments along the way. But here’s the thing: You now have another credit card.\n\nLet’s say you charge other items to the card. You make more than the minimum payment in an effort to pay off at least the items purchased as part of the deferred interest promotion. Credit card companies can apply your payments to purchases with the highest APR first, which may not be the items bought under the deferred interest promotion. There is an exception, however. In the last two months of a deferred interest period, if you pay more than the minimum monthly payment, your card issuer has to allocate that money to pay down your deferred interest purchases.\n\n■ You need to be clear on how you want your payments allocated. The CFPB says credit card companies are not required to honor your request, but ask nonetheless. Request that the card issuer apply payments to the deferred interest balance first. Better yet, don’t put anything else on the card during the deferred period.\n\nWhen it comes to deferred interest promotions, you could be taking a big financial risk unless you already have the cash stashed away. Don’t get caught up in the excitement of free money because you could end up paying big time.",

        "instruction": "SALT LAKE CITY— DAY and night artificial hearts, small, medium and large, pump with a ceaseless liquid clicking sound in a bare laboratory room here. They will be kept going until they break. One of the hearts has been clicking out its message of durability and survival since April 7, 1978.\n\nA few doors away, five calves and a sheep gaze stolidly from cages. They are alive because an artificial heart, like those down the hall, beats in each chest.\n\nBy yesterday, one large brown calf named Alfred Lord Tennyson had been living that way for 260 days. A blue and white sign above his stall proclaims Tennyson ''The Champ.''\n\nThe artificial hearts and the animals using them testify to the readiness of a research team at the University of Utah Medical Cengreat daring and potential significance -equipping a human with an artificial heart.\n\nLast week they received approval from the university to put such a device in a patient who would otherwise face immediate death from heart disease.\n\nThis week, Dr. Willem C. Kolff, overall director of the research, plans to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of investigational use of an artificial heart in humans. Approval by the drug agency is the last procedural step before the heart, the product of more than 20 years of research, can be used in an attempt to give life back to a dying patient.\n\nNo one can predict how long it will be before the first patient is chosen. The decision will come only in the operating room when the heart of a patient who has undergone conventional surgery just cannot be revived. Only when all known methods for reviving the natural heart fail and the team would ordinarily give up and turn off the heart-lung machine that has been keeping the patient alive will the doctors turn to the artificial heart.\n\nThe patient will have been told, before the operation, that there was a large chance that the natural heart could not be repaired. At that time a suitable patient would be given a chance to volunteer for an artificial heart.\n\nIn practice a patient might be wheeled into the operating room at 7 A.M. and be wheeled out again with an artificial heart by 6 P.M. Only on awakening from the surgery will the first recipient know for certain that an artificial pump is beating in the chest. It could be psychologically disturbing to awaken without one's own heart but with the prospect of a lifetime tethered by six-foot tubes to an external power source for the pneumatically driven heart, a limitation that is still necessary with the current model.\n\nThe heart will allow its user to move from place to place with some freedom, but the power system will have to be pulled along on a cart. The patient's home will need special equipment, including an air compressor and wall outlets, as well as compressed air tanks for emergency use and for ventures beyond the range of the built-in system.\n\nThus, only candidates and families deemed likely to cope well with such circumstances will be considered. The spouse will be at least as important as the patient, said Dr. William C. DeVries, who heads the research team and will do the actual surgery. He is chairman of the medical center's division of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery.\n\nDr. DeVries estimates that 5,000 American heart patients a year die after surgery because they cannot be weaned from the heart-lung machines that sustain them during the operations. In the long run a far wider patient group will probably be considered if the artificial heart proves successful. A Federal study has estimated that 17,000 to 50,000 patients a year might be suitable candidates.\n\nArtificial devices that assist the failing heart without totally or permanently replacing it have been used more than 200 times during the past five years, but with few longterm survivors. Only once has a complete artificial heart been used. The intention then was to buy time beyond the several hours available from heart-lung machines. In 1969 Dr. Denton Cooley of the Texas Heart Institute put an artificial heart in a 47-year-old man who was on the brink of death. It kept him alive for more than 60 hours -time enough to find a donor for a natural heart transplant. But 32 hours after the transplant the patient died of pneumonia and the effects of the drugs needed to help his body accept the foreign heart. Since then, so far as specialists know, no one has attempted any comparable feat.\n\nWhen the first such attempt is made in Salt Lake City, the intention will be permanent replacement of a human heart and ''a suitable and acceptable life style'' at home. A Very Special Pump\n\nLike the natural heart, the artificial heart is only a pump. But, also like the natural heart, it is a pump that must work for a lifetime without fail. If it stops for as much as 10 seconds the person will lose consciousness. If it stops for more than five minutes the person will usually die.\n\nExtreme reliability is an absolute necessity in an artificial heart. ''It is probably acceptable to build an only moderately good artificial arm,'' said one scientist recently. ''An only moderately good artificial heart is useless.''",

One of the hearts has been clicking out its message of durability and survival since April 7, 1978.   A few doors away, five calves and a sheep gaze stolidly from cages. They are alive because an artificial heart, like those down the hall, beats in each chest.   By yesterday, one large brown calf named Alfred Lord Tennyson had been living that way for 260 days. A blue and white sign above his stall proclaims Tennyson ''The Champ.''"

        "instruction": "DALLAS— Edith Axelrod's former neighbors in Manhasset Hills, L.I., would not know what to make of her. ''I listen to country and western music, I date a lot of men who drive pickups and I go target shooting,'' said Mrs. Axelrod, who moved to Dallas eight years ago. ''I'm also into metaphysics. I leave my metaphysics class and go country dancing. But I still feel like a New Yorker. I think like a New Yorker. I believe I live in Dallas, Long Island, New York.''\n\nJeannette Vota, another transplanted New Yorker, figured that there were probably other emigres from the Northeast afflicted with this kind of cultural schizophrenia, so she formed the New York Circle, an informal social club for those who still think of Yankees as a baseball team, not a regional epithet, and who will never quite come to grips with living in a town where you get tickets for jaywalking.\n\n''You should have heard how excited they all sounded when they answered my ad,'' she said in an accent that owed more to the Grand Concourse than the Big D. ''I mean, you would have thought we were on the moon or something.''\n\nAbout 45 people showed up in April for the first meeting, and 100, including Mrs. Axelrod, came to the second, on May 31. Most are reasonably well adjusted to a city in which the natives never boo the home team and believe there is no such thing as pizza by the slice. But adjusting and assimilating are not the same thing, said Mrs. Vota, a 49-year-old Manhattan native who moved to Texas nearly five years ago.\n\n''New Yorkers to me almost represent an ethnic group,'' Mrs. Vota said at the restaurant where the New York Circle met in May. ''I mean, we are different. We understand one another like ethnic groups do. We all talk rapidly, and if we say Bloomingdale's, everyone knows right away what we're talking about.''\n\nThe group is more ecumenical than its name implies. The second meeting attracted people from upstate New York, New Jersey, Boston and Philadelphia. If all they had in common was their Northern accents, that was enough for some.\n\n''Why am I here?'' said Gwen Timmins, formerly of Fairlawn, N.J., who has lived in Dallas since 1957. ''To meet people who don't hate me because I have a Yankee accent.''\n\nMrs. Vota thought her organization might help some people make friends. Malcolm Nordstrom from Nutley, N.J., and Larry Kerner from Brooklyn found something more important to them. They found paddle ball partners, as rare a commodity in Dallas as an egg cream.\n\n''You found a wall?'' an incredulous Mr. Kerner asked. ''A wall's easy to find,'' Mr. Nordstrom replied. ''A partner's not. Where did you used to play?'' ''I was a member of the Brighton Beach Baths for 28 years,'' Mr. Kerner said. That brought a second of respectful silence. ''Some sharpies there,'' Mr. Nordstrom said. ''Some real sharpies.'' Many reported a similar pattern of adaptation - a few months of trauma followed by a growing appreciation of Dallas's warm weather, slower pace and relatively friendly atmosphere. Few expressed any interest in returning to the Northeast.\n\n''At first I hated it,'' said Donna Coyne, who came to Dallas when American Airlines moved here in 1978. ''I thought there was nothing worse. But now I like it here. I still have a lot of New York in me, but this place is becoming more and more like home.''\n\nMarti Silverstein, formerly of Philadelphia, said: ''I thought of going back one winter, and then I came out in the morning and scraped the eighth of an inch of ice off the windshield, and it was already in the 50's. I thought: 'What am I, crazy? You have to be nuts to go back.' ''\n\nMrs. Vota said she and a friend first thought of getting a group of New Yorkers together shortly after she arrived in Dallas but did not advertise in local papers and on radio until this spring. Now she is planning a theater party in Dallas and has arranged a cruise in July on nearby Lake Grapevine, one of the few available bodies of water on the northern Texas prairie.\n\n''So it's not the East River,'' Mrs. Vota said.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Jeannette Vota",

        "instruction": "TRENTON, Oct. 6— Neither President Reagan nor Governor Byrne will have a great impact on the election of a New Jersey Governor, according to a poll released yesterday by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nOf 1,004 state residents polled between Sept. 15 and 27, 70 percent said a Reagan or Byrne endorsement would have no effect on their decision to vote for either former Assembly Speaker Thomas H. Kean, the Republican candidate, or Representative James J. Florio, the Democratic candidate.\n\nMr. Reagan, though still popular among Republicans, has lost much of his Democratic support in the state. Nearly half of those sampled believe he has gone too far in cutting back on social programs, according to Dr. Clifford Zukin, the poll director.\n\nIn addition, while Mr. Byrne's job rating has declined - less than one in four New Jerseyans believe he is doing a good job - most residents believe Mr. Florio would bring new ideas and new people to Trenton and would not represent a continuation of the current administration.\n\nMr. Kean has been criticizing Mr. Byrne because his polls also show the Governor to be unpopular. Mr. Kean has tried to link Mr. Florio with Mr. Byrne, but this has not proved succesful, according to the Eagleton survey. Mr. Byrne endorsed the former Attorney General, John J. Degnan, over Mr. Florio in the June primary and has made only one appearance with the candidate, at a bill-signing ceremony last week after the Governor returned from a trip abroad.\n\nOverall, 23 percent rated Mr. Byrne's performance in office positively, compared with a 26 percent rating in May and 33 percent last September. Statewide, 45 percent would like to see the Governor's name removed from the Brendan T. Byrne Arena in the Hackensack Meadowlands. Among those who had an opinion on the issue, 60 percent favored a name change.\n\nWhile both Mr. Kean and Mr. Florio have insisted that the election would be decided on state issues, both men were aware of the possible influence Mr. Reagan and Mr. Byrne c ould have on their campaigns. Reagan Visit Scheduled\n\nMr. Reagan will visit New Jersey on Oct. 15 for two Republican fund-raising events. Vice President Bush has said the New Jersey election will be viewed as a referendum on Reagan policies.\n\nAgainst that background, 49 percent of those polled evaluated Mr. Reagan's performance as ''excellent'' or ''good,'' 29 percent said ''only fair'' and 17 percent said ''poor.''\n\nIn an Eagleton poll in May, 65 percent gave the President a favorable rating. The President's p ositive rating dropped 9 points among Republi cans, to 81 percent, in the new poll, declined 11 pointsamong indepen dents, to 50 percent, and dropped 27 points among Democrats, to 25 percent.\n\nForty-six percent of the poll sample said Mr. Reagan's cuts in social programs had gone too far, while 13 percent said the cuts did not go far enough and 31 percent said they were ''just right.'' Dr. Zukin said most of the polling was completed before the President announced his second round of budget cuts and before his televised appeal for public support.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Thomas H.

        "instruction": "HE has slipped to No. 2 on the computer, shuns Davis Cup commitments, plays more exhibitions than tournaments and lost more events than he won in the last year. And as Bjorn Borg prepares for the one championship that has become his obsession, the United States Open, there are whispers that maybe, just maybe, the Garbo of tennis may be more vulnerable than he looks on the court.\n\n- Borg's current point average on the Association of Tennis Professionals computer is 77.58, his lowest since Nov. 20, 1978, and a drop of more than 20 points from the same period preceding last year's United States Open. As late as last April 6, Borg's average was 110.17, the highest total ever recorded since the men's rankings were initiated. By contrast, since last year's Open, John McEnroe, now No. 1, has improved his computer average from 90.22 to 95.53.\n\n- Since last year's Open, Borg has played 12 tournaments and won only four. During the same period, McEnroe played 15 tournaments and won 10, in addition to the World Championship of Tennis title, the Pepsi Grand Slam and several Davis Cup matches.\n\n- Borg lost the Wimbledon final to McEnroe in four sets and has played only one tournament, on clay, in Stuttgart, West Germany, since mid-July. McEnroe won a $200,000 Grand Prix tournament in Ohio a week ago yesterday on the same asphalt-type surface as the National Tennis Center, site of tomorrow's start of the Open.\n\nHas money, marriage, and a strenuous seven-year run up the ladder dulled some of Borg's drive? During the Canadian Open in Montreal earlier this month, where Borg withdrew because of a strepped throat and his wife's illness, Peter McNamara of Australia, beaten by Borg at Wimbledon, offered this view:\n\n''From now on, it's going to show whether he's one of the greatest players,'' McNamara said. ''If he doesn't come back, he's still one of the greats. But all the great tennis players - Laver, Gonzales, Tilden - made comebacks. They all stopped for awhile, had a rest and came back and proved they were No. 1. He has to prove a point. He wants to win the U. S. Open.''\n\nLast Friday, when asked to reflect Borg's current No. 2 status, Arthur Ashe said, ''the record speaks for itself. In this day and age, it's tough. Five Wimbledons and six French titles. That wasn't lucky. Plus, he's got another seven or eight years to play.''\n\nWhat about Borg's attitude? Has he written off everything but the majors? ''I think it's sad,'' said Ashe, the United States Davis Cup captain. ''I hate to see him schedule the way he's doing it. I wish he'd play more tournaments. He's obviously the best player in the world, and he's our biggest draw. You could say he's not playing tournaments to last longer, but he's playing exhibitions anyway, so there's only one conclusion - money.''\n\nEarl (Butch) Buchholz, a former world-class player, is currently executive director of the Association of Tennis Professionals. ''I think Borg's going through a similar thing that Chris Evert Lloyd went through a few years ago,'' Buchholz said. ''He's been out there for seven years with an enormous amount of pressure to play tournaments, make promotional appearances, do exhibitions. I think the guy's tired. He finds it hard to get out there and get fired up. I have a lot of sympathy for the guy. He literally can't go out to dinner anywhere anymore. He's tired, he needs a break to get his batteries recharged. It helped Chrissie.\n\n''Look at what's happened to Borg in the last year? He went through all those preparations for the wedding, was injured and just missed winning the Open. After that, with the exception of the majors, I just think he let his hair down. That can become a habit. I've got to believe that subconsciously he's thinking: 'Do I have to go out there and pull again today? I need a break.' In his way, he's taking it.''\n\nIf Borg's world focuses on what Ion Tiriac calls ''shopping expeditions'' in the French, Wimbledon and United States Opens, along with the season-ending Volvo Masters, can he come in from his islands in Sweden, Monte Carlo and Sands Point and still sustain a game that demands so much concentration and commitment?\n\n''When you have money in the bank, as he has, and to have as much success as he's had,'' said Bill Talbert, the tournament director for the United States Open, ''that hunger has to suffer. I think he'll try to key himself for the Open and Masters and other majors. But to do it week after week, I don't think he can do it anymore.''\n\n''To play one tournament since Wimbledon and expect to win the U. S. Open,'' said Althea Gibson, a former women's champion, ''I think it's almost an impossible feat unless that person is extremely, extremely disciplined.''\n\n''Very few people can,'' added Harry Hopman, the former Australian Davis Cup captain, who tutored Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Lew Hoad, Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle and others. ''Someone like Raul Ramirez needs to play a lot to stay fit. Emmo needed work. If Fred didn't run, it turned to fat. Rocket was a hard worker and enjoyed it. I think Borg's proven he can do it. His responsibility now is to himself.''",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, April 30— For the Consumer Product Safety Commission one of the first signs of summer appears on a computer printout that shows a sudden increase in injuries associated with amusement rides.\n\nThe number of injuries is relatively small and many are unavoidable or are caused by rider misbehavior. Nevertheless, the commission believes that many accidents are preventable and is trying to encourage safety programs in the states, only 19 of which mandate safety inspections.\n\nThe commission collects data on injuries as a way of identifying risks associated with particular consumer products and setting priorities for investigations. If the commission determines that injuries are related to a product defect, it encourages the manufacturer to correct the problem before issuing a complaint and possibly resolving the issue in court.\n\nBased on reports from 71 hospital emergency wards last year, the commission says that seven people died and estimates that 14,000 were hurt in accidents associated with the hundreds of kinds of amusement rides to be found in shopping centers, bars, street fairs and amusement parks. The figure for injuries represents a 40 percent increase over 1980, principally because some 5,600 people got hurt trying to hang onto the latest fad, mechanical bulls and broncos. Developed to train rodeo competitors, they have become popular in parks and Western-style bars. Breaks and sprains are among common injuries; a paraplegia case has been reported.\n\nA spokesman for the amusement-park industry said the risks were insignificant and questioned the agency's injury estimates. ''The industry has an exemplary safety record, considering about 170 million people take about one billion rides a year,'' said John Graff, spokesman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.\n\nCiting commission statistics, he said that more people get hurt playing billiards. While commission staff members agree, they note that the severity of the injuries associated with amusement rides is vastly greater. They added that many of the accidents result from product defects, mechanical malfunctions and improper maintenance or operation.\n\n''People get poked with cue sticks or hit with billiard balls, but people on amusement rides sprain ankles, smash fingers and break bones,'' said George Rutherford, a senior statistician at the product agency.\n\nAccidents can also be catastrophic. In 1979 two gondolas at the Texas State Fair dropped 85 feet, killing a man and leaving a 20-year-old woman a quadriplegic. The woman recently won a $3.81 million settlement on the basis that the gondola had been operated negligently in high winds; as part of the settlement the manufacturer agreed to promote the installation of wind monitors on all gondola rides.\n\nStatistically, no single ride appears particularly dangerous except for the mechanical rodeo animals and for water slides. Most of the 2,300 people estimated to be injured last year on the slides bumped into one another; in one instance a slide collapsed and fell 40 feet, injuring many. In the miscellaneous category are 300 injuries on roller coasters, 300 on Ferris wheels and 500 on so-called kiddie rides.\n\nKiddie rides - the gently bouncing mechanical animals that can be found at shopping centers - illustrate that accidents are not entirely caused by mechanical malfunction. Many result from inadequate parental attention or misbehavior by riders.\n\n''The number of injuries is relatively small, but many of the injuries are preventable,'' Sam Zagoria, a commission member, said, adding that there was little prevention.\n\nIn an antiregulatory mood last year, Congress stripped the agency of its jurisdiction over fixed amusement rides. The amusement parks had lobbied for the bill, contending that the number of injuries could not justify the commission's regulatory presence. ''It was impractical, expensive and unnecessary,'' Mr. Graff said.\n\nThe commission, preoccupied last summer with Congressional and Reagan Administration attempts to abolish it, lost track of the legislation,which slipped through Congress without much discussion. As a result the commission can inspect and regulate only itinerant amusement rides, leaving amusement parks in many states free of governmental oversight (in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, regulations cover amusement parks as well as mobile caravans). New York Law Being Pushed\n\nWith the exception of the regulations in New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, most of the laws and enforcement are inadequate in the states that have them, Mr. Zagoria told the Consumer Affairs and Protection Committee of the New York Assembly two weeks ago. Assemblyman Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx, has introduced legislation in Albany to increase supervision of amusement rides. It would supplement existing safety requirements and increase the enforcement staff with money raised from new license fees on about 2,000 traveling caravans and 50 parks. Companion legislation exists in the State Senate; Assemblyman Serrano is optimistic.\n\nSince 1975 New Jersey has had state engineers inspect all amusement rides at least three or four times a year. ''We've gotten a reputation for being tough, so we get the newest, best carnival equipment coming into the state,'' said William J. Clark, associate commissioner of the Department of Labor. Last year state engineers refused permits to about 30 operators.\n\nIn some of the states with safety laws the department of labor or an engineering department has authority over rides, but in Connecticut it is the State Police. Lieut. Edmund Dunstone, head of the inspection unit, said his 14 troopers had no formal training and learned on the job. ''These caravan rides are held together with cotter pins, which fall out easily,'' he said. He maintained that the police presence, at the least, encouraged operators to be more conscientious.\n\nWhat the unit lacks in expertise it tries to balance with persistence. Troopers inspect each amusement ride every time it is set up in a new location. In addition to the almost weekly inspections, the rides must be certified as safe at the beginning of the season by a registered engineer employed by the operators. ''That's the part I don't like,'' said Lieutenant Dunstone, who believes state engineers should inspect.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of roller coaster and mechanical bull",

        "output": "For the Consumer Product Safety Commission one of the first signs of summer appears on a computer printout that shows a sudden increase in injuries associated with amusement rides.   The number of injuries is relatively small and many are unavoidable or are caused by rider misbehavior. Nevertheless, the commission believes that many accidents are preventable and is trying to encourage safety programs in the states, only 19 of which mandate safety inspections.   The commission collects data on injuries as a way of identifying risks associated with particular consumer products and setting priorities for investigations. If the commission determines that injuries are related to a product defect, it encourages the manufacturer to correct the problem before issuing a complaint and possibly resolving the issue in court."

        "instruction": "BEIJING — Uber Technologies Inc. isn’t just ramping up its business in China — the mobile ride-hailing service is starting to draw investment interest there as well.\n\nA unit of China’s Citic Group Corp. is planning to invest $100 million in the San Francisco-based company, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nLanding an investment from the state-controlled entity may help accelerate Uber’s business in China. It’s investing more than $1.1 billion to expand in the country, with plans to start operating in 50 midsized cities in the next year. Users of the Uber app complete almost 1 million rides daily in China, which is is expected to outgrow Uber’s US home market by the end of this year, chief executive Travis Kalanick wrote in a letter to investors in June.\n\nCitic-CP Asset Management, a joint venture between Citic Trust and Citic-Prudential Fund Management, plans to invest about 80 percent of the $100 million in Uber and about 20 percent in its China unit, said the person, who asked not be identified because the plans are private. Uber has said that its China unit could at some point be listed on the Chinese stock market, without providing a time frame.\n\nUber’s Beijing-based spokeswoman Huang Xue couldn’t immediately comment. A call to Citic-CP Asset Management outside usual business hours went unanswered.\n\nIt wasn’t clear how the latest investment would impact Uber’s valuation, which was pegged at about $50 billion in the last financing round.\n\nDidi Kuaidi, Uber’s main competitor in China, is backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.

        "instruction": "Planting goes on: bulbs, evergreens, perennials; prepare soil well and water plants in, especially if there is no rainfall. . . . It is getting late to plant grass seed; however, if it does not not germinate this season, it will next spring. . . . Transplant hardy 'mums to patio tubs for late season color. Fuchsias\n\nJuly was hard on fuchsia plants hung from limbs of shade trees, under patio awnings or lath shelters. If it was not white flies, then the heat got them. Plants that were cut back lightly and fed have come back and are thriving in this cooler growing weather.\n\nBut what to do with these plants now? Those who have a greenhou se can answer th e question easily. Move them indoors un der th e glass roof. As bloom tapers off, the fuchsias are cut back and s tored.\n\nThose who do not have a greenhouse have to find some practical way to ''store'' plants over winter. All fuchsias need a rest or dormant period during the winter months. Ideally this storage place should be a cool (50 degrees) poorly lighted place where plants are watered less and less to dry off gradually.\n\nDuring storage, stems must be checked every few weeks so they do not shrivel. One or two light waterings until late January may be necessary. Before the first of February, plants are stirred back to growth by taking them to light, watering and feeding. Old straggly woody stems are pruned back to live buds.\n\nJust as important as cool storage is pest control before storage. The synthetic pyrethrums called resmethrin do a fairly good job. So does the newer Safer Insecticial Soap. Some gardeners have been able to control white flies and aphids by soaking the entire fuchsia plant in a large tub of mild liquid Ivory sudsy water, rinsing after a few minutes and draining. Help the Trees\n\nTrees have had a difficult year. First, the drought last fall and winter. Next, for the second year in a row, defoliation by gypsy moth caterpillars.\n\nAlthough shade trees put out new sets of leaves in August, this is not their normal pattern. Production of the second set of leaves consumed food reserves trees would have used to produce next spring's leaves. In short, trees are hungry and need fertilizer.\n\nThere is plenty of time to feed trees. After leaves fall would be ideal. But since so many garden centers store away fertilizers and tools to make space for bulbs and Christmas season stock, buy fertilizer soon. Tree experts claim that tree roots will function long after air temperatures cool down. As long as soil temperature is around 40 to 45 degrees, roots will grow and make use of nutrients.\n\nFor small trees - dogwoods, crabapples, magnolias, flowering cherries and other specimens on the lawn, surface feeding is ideal. Broadcast the fertilizer lightly under the tree's drip line and be careful to use the amount recommended on the label. A good tree fertilizer formula is 10-10-10.\n\nLarger shade trees will benefit from injection feeding. These long metal tubes with perforations can be attached to garden hoses. Fertilizer cartridges inside are dissolved when the water is turned on. Questions & Answers CHICKWEED\n\nLast spring our lawn was inundated with chickweed. We sprayed with chickweed weedkiller. Now the weed is coming back in greater number. Any ideas? Mrs. P.L.M., Madison, N.J.\n\nThis is a good time to control most lawn weeds. Chickweed usually succumbs to dicamba. In fall, weeds can be snuffed out before they flower and set seed. Other lawn weeds to control now are ground ivy, yellow wood sorrel, clover, henbit and most broadleaved weeds such as dandelion and plantain. Several lawn herbicides are on the market: 2,4-D, dicamba, mecoprop (MCPP) or combinations of these such as Spectrum 33 Plus which is 2,4-D and dicamba. Check product labels and apply at correct rates. Repeat applications in two to three weeks may be necessary, but wait patiently as herbicides do not show results for a week or more. UNWANTED HONEYSUCKLE\n\nIs there an easy way to get rid of honeysuckle plants other than pulling them out one by one? H.C.S., Sloatsburg, N.Y.\n\nSeveral non-selective weedkillers such as Ammate (ammonium sulfamate) or Kleen-Up (glyphosate) might be tried. These products wipe out most vegetation in their path - weeds and some woody species - and cannot be used near croplands. The local Cooperative Extension office and/or Soil Conservation District officer can provide guidance on this problem. MAPLE BONSAI\n\nMy Japanese maple bonsai was potted four years ago and has grown well. This year, although it has many buds, few opened. Any suggestions? H.S., Manhattan.\n\nEven though a bonsai is a tree in miniature, its cultural needs do not change. Japanese maple is a hardy outdoor tree and requires a dormant cold period. Bonsai plants for apartments survive better if developed from species adapted to indoor culture. Handbooks on bonsai training and maintenance are available from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11225. A list of titles can be obtained from the garden.\n\nReaders are invited to submit garden questions or share their gardening tips. Letters of general interest will be published.

        "instruction": "S OME 30 years ago, when he was 51 years old, Bert Luckenbach, now a retired real estate broker from Allentown, Pa., bought 25 shares of Conoco. By last year, after other purchases, stock splits and the reinvestment of his dividends, Mr. Luckenbach and his wife, Clara, had 412 shares.\n\nThen last summer, when war broke out over Conoco between Seagram, Mobil and Du Pont, the Luckenbachs told Du Pont they would accept its offer of $98 a share - in cash. Had they wanted, they could have received 1.6 shares of Du Pont for each of Conoco.\n\nDu Pont, which subsequently took over Conoco, wrote back that the couple had filled out the papers incorrectly and would get Du Pont's stock.\n\nThe Luckenbachs, unfortunately, are not alone. Evidence is growing that takeover battles confuse thousands of investors and even professionals.\n\nIn a few of their calamities, the professionals, known as risk arbitragers, guessed wrong when California Standard m ade overtures toward Amax, when Grumman bid for LTV and whe n Southland Royalty put itself on the block. In still other unsuccess ful deals somewhat earlier, the arbitragers suffered losses when Brascan sought Woolworth, Anderson-Clayton tried to land Ger ber and American Expresswent after McGraw-Hill.\n\nIf the professionals make mistakes - well over $100 million worth in the last couple of years - your chances of failure are multiplied. There are ways, of course, to protect yourself. The experts spend all day working on a handful of takeover deals, sharing information, paying for advice and every scrap of information. Investors therefore should be more careful about what they do in response to takeover developments unless they, too, are willing to work as hard.\n\nIn Cincinnati, in the aftermath of United States Steel's victory over Mobil in taking over Marathon Oil, Irving and Charlotte Radol of Little Neck, N.Y., owners of 100 shares of Marathon, sued U.S. Steel, contending that while U.S. Steel paid $125 a share, in cash, for 51 percent of Marathon stock, the rest of Marathon's stockholders got U.S. Steel notes worth $75 to $80. Terms of U.S. Steel's offer, however, had been disseminated. While the value of the notes slid, anyone faced with getting them instead of cash could have asked a broker how much they were worth.\n\nAnother New Yorker, who requested anonymity, asked why U.S. Steel paid him in notes instead of in cash, as he had requested. U.S. Steel said it would pay cash for 51 percent of Marathon but so many wanted cash that U.S. Steel got more stock than it sought. Therefore, it prorated the amount it would take. Ignoring that, when he heard U.S. Steel was keeping its offer open, he bought Marathon at $90 and then offered it to U.S. Steel for $125.\n\nYes, the offer had been kept open, but by court order, to enable anyone to take back stock. However, few took back stock and therefore U.S. Steel had far too much. As it said, those who did not meet the cash deadline would get notes.\n\nHow, then, can you protect yourself? One important rule is not to buy on rumors. Many turn out to be real. More often, they are too risky.\n\nThen, even when one company says it is interested in another company or says it has even invested in one, you have to ask yourself what the chances are of this leading to a takeover.\n\nTake antitrust. Company A announces an offer to Company B. Company A automatically must file data about the venture with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, one of which will review any antitrust problem. If the Government does nothing within 30 days, Company A is free to act. If the Government seeks more data, the offer is delayed 20 days from delivery.\n\nThen, too, the more hostile the takeover, the more difficult it becomes to understand. If Company B is not interested in the offer, it could be doing several things. It could be raising money to buy back its own stock, it could be looking around for a friendly buyer -a white knigh t - instead of Company A, or it could be preparing a lawsuit to fi ght off the challenger.\n\nYou don't know, for example, whether the company will offer to buy its own stock, and, if so, how much it will pay and how much it will buy. Neither do you know, if it gets more than it wants, how much of your stock it will accept. Then, if the company goes after a white knight, you don't know whether it will find one. And if it does, will Company A stay in the battle? If it does, which bidder will prevail? And what about the lawsuit? Will it be good enough to fight off Company A? And what about the Government? Will it eventually clear Company A?\n\nThen, too, there are the intricacies of tender offers themselves, with proration dates, withdrawal dates and expiration dates, all of which have a bearing on whether you will get paid in cash, if you wish, in stock, if you like, or in something other than what you want - whether you like it or not.\n\nFirst, the proration date. If Company A says that to get cash you must tender your stock by a specific time, then that's the deadline to get cash. There generally are exceptions, such as when Company A does not get all the stock it wants by deadline, or when some investors decide to take back their stock. But typically more people want cash so that to guarantee equal treatment for those that do, a deadline is set. Those that tender their stock late can almost be certain they will not get what they requested.\n\nThe withdrawal date is simply the deadline for you to take back your stock. If you do, for whatever reason, you lose your place in the proration line. You might be able to go back later if there is still room. The date becomes important when more than one bidder is fighting for a company. You have to decide which offer to take. If they feel confident, professionals generally send the stock to the first bidder and, as circumstances deepen, decide what to do from there on.\n\nThe expiration date, as it implies, is the end of the offer. None of these dates, however, is always the final word. A brand new bidder creates a new proration date for itself, although the others stay the same. The new bidder also extends al l withdrawal dates by 10business days, to enable investors to shift t heir stock, if they choose, from one bidder to another. If an old bidder, such as CompanyA, then raises its bid, Company A's proration date is extended by 10 calendar days. Moreover, when a new bidder an nounces its intention toincrease an outstanding offer, it must do so within five days.\n\nNow let's say you know the basics. You read that David Murdock, the financier, is offering $44 a share for Cannon Mills. It is subject to approval by Cannon family trusts owning 27 percent. Directors are neutral but 40 percent of the stock is controlled by family and friends, whose attitude seems negative. If you already own the stock, you could sell it in the market and insure some profit now or offer it to Mr. Murdock and take a chance for bigger profits later. But if you have to buy Cannon in the market before tendering to Mr. Murdock, you only win if he buys it. It's your move.",

        "instruction": "IN the last few years physicians practicing in rented quarters in cooperative apartment houses on the Upper East Side have been making an interesting discovery when their leases come due: The cooperative wants to sell them their space.\n\nAnd having little relocation opportunity in the area, they have been buying, paying prices that vary widely depending upon many variables.\n\n''My overhead quadrupled in three months,'' said one internist who contracted last July to buy 1,250 square feet of space for $128,000. He said he had to put a larger mortgage on his house to raise the money. ''There's no tax advantage to owning,'' he said. ''It just ties up money.''\n\nWith rents reported doubling and even tripling as doctors' threeyear leases come due, the practice of buying space is said to be accelerating. But little new space specifically designed for physicians has come on the market.\n\nOne exception is the Manhattan East Medical Offices at 225 East 64th Street, where a real estate company specializing in facilities for doctors is offering renovated space along with specialized services in a rental apartment building on a novel basis, the ''coterminus lease.''\n\nThe entrepreneur is Bradford Medical Building Associates, a privately owned company founded in New Jersey in 1972 by Bernard J. Goz, an engineer, to develop and manage offices for physicians. In Manhattan Bradford has developed and leased out or sold space to physicians at 64 University Place, at 1995 Broadway and at 1 Lincoln Plaza.\n\nTwo years ago Bradford leased 20,000 square feet of raw space on three levels - street level, below grade and one level above grade - in the new apartment house whose main entrance is at 225 East 65th Street. It is a long, low section of the midblock apartment house on the 64th Street side.\n\nThe street-level space of 7,000 square feet has been renovated into separate physicians' offices, suitable for perhaps 15 doctors to function in spaces of 200 or 300 square feet. The lower level is for ancillary laboratory space plus an ambulatory surgical section with five operating rooms and many recovery rooms. The upper level provides more space for doctors' offices, plus administrative offices for Bradford Associates, a diagnostic area and a library and conference room.\n\nThe physician can take space with or without the back-up administrative services that Bradford offers. But the unusual element from a real estate standpoint is that the doctor can sign either a short-term sublease from Bradford as a pure rental, or buy the space for up to the 15 years of Bradford's own lease with the building's owner. The purchase price for this coterminus lease includes the renovation work plus whatever services the physician accepts.\n\nIn one example, the physician can lease space for $25 to $35 a square foot, depending on how many services are taken, for three years. But after that the space is rerented at the market rate. Alternatively, the physician can sign a coterminus lease, expiring when Bradford's own lease expires, making a large ''up-front'' payment but lowering the monthly costs to about $10 to $12 a square foot. This payment covers Bradford's construction and financing costs on its $1.5 million investment, plus a profit factor, Mr. Goz said.\n\nThe theory is that the value of the sublease will appreciate in time and the physician will have a salable asset. In one deal so far, a plastic surgeon took 1,800 square feet of renovated space for $150,000,\n\nAccording to Nathan H. Friedman, a broker at Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives who specializes in medical facilities, many East Side cooperatives have converted and consolidated underutilized space into doctors' offices in the last few years. Through Douglas Elliman alone, more than 50 rental spaces in cooperative buildings, ranging in size from perhaps 500 square feet to 4,500 square feet, have been sold to physicians as cooperatives.\n\nThe prices for this space can vary drastically based on the condition of the offices, the share allocation in the cooperative corporation, the location and more, he said. The market at present is between $100 and $200 a square foot, he said, depending in major part on the allocation of shares to the space. A higher share allocation, and thus a higher monthly carrying charge, will mean a lower initial purchase price.\n\nDoctors themselves, from all accounts, have had little bargaining power when their space is offered for sale. Moving is difficult for many physicians even if alternate space were available, and it generally isn't. Cooperatives themselves have used the additional income from sale of the space for various building improvements. Some doctors are said to have retired rather than make the new investment needed to buy their space.\n\nDifferent types of practices have different space needs. ''The radiologist can't afford to move his heavy equipment,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''He must have a long lease or own his office.''",

        "output": "IN the last few years physicians practicing in rented quarters in cooperative apartment houses on the Upper East Side have been making an interesting discovery when their leases come due: The cooperative wants to sell them their space.   And having little relocation opportunity in the area, they have been buying, paying prices that vary widely depending upon many variables.   ''My overhead quadrupled in three months,'' said one internist who contracted last July to buy 1,250 square feet of space for $128,000.  He said he had to put a larger mortgage on his house to raise the money. ''There's no tax advantage to owning,'' he said. ''It just ties up money.''"

        "instruction": "''EVERYTHING'S up to date in Kansas City,'' a singer in the musical play ''Oklahoma'' assures us. ''They've gone about as fer as they can go.''\n\nWell, they've gone a little further now. The Kansas City Board of Trade recently became the nation's first market for trading stock index futures, with the action centered on an octagonal pit in Missouri. ''It's not a market you play to send your kids to college,'' said one observer of the scene. ''It's short-term, highrisk, high-reward.''\n\nIt's also the newest financial instrument that can change the way professionals and well-heeled investors attempt to hedge their stock portfolios against market declines. For speculators, it's a new way to play the swings of the stock market.\n\nThe Kansas City Board of Trade has initiated commodity contracts geared to Arnold Bernhard & Company's Value Line Index of 1,685 stocks. Most of the issues are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, while the rest are actively traded on the American Stock Exchange and in the over-the-counter market.\n\nA futures contract is an obligation to buy or sell any commodity at a specific price at a stated month in the future. Stock index futures differ from traditional commodities, such as wheat, in that there is no physical commodity underlying the contract. Also, stock index futures are settled in cash, rather than involving any delivery of actual securities.\n\nDifferences exist between futures contracts and option contracts known as puts and calls. The holder of an option does not own the underlying security; he simply has the right to buy or sell it at a fixed price within a specific time period. As a result, the owner of an option cannot lose more than the initial cost of the contract. But a speculator in futures is subject to large potential losses, in the event the market moves against him.\n\nThe kickoff date for trading stock index futures in Kansas City was Feb. 24 for six evenly spaced contract months from March 1982 to June 1983. Each full point in the Value Line Index is assigned a value of $500, so that initially the nearer-term contracts were worth about $63,000 each.\n\nHow's it going so far? In New York, Dorothy A. Berry, president of Arnold Bernhard & Company, said Friday: ''There has been a lot of interest in the index. We've had a great number of inquiries from brokers and other interested parties.''\n\nIn Kansas City, Harold Bradley, marketing director for the Board of Trade, gave this progress report: ''Our volume has averaged about 2,000 contracts a day, and that's better than we expected. Our first survey showed that 38 percent of the people on the short side of the market were classified as hedgers, while 56 percent on the long side were hedgers. This indicates to us that the hedgers are standing back to see how the new market performs.''\n\nA hedger in stock index futures may be a money manager or an institution or an individual with a good-sized portfolio. To qualify as a hedger, one must own a portfolio equal in value to the contract. The initial cost is $3,250 a contract. A speculator makes an initial deposit of $6,500 a contract.\n\nOn Friday the four contract expiration months in 1982 all were trading at a slight discount from the Value Line Index, while the two expirations in 1983 were at a slight premium. Viewed as a sentiment indicator, this apparently meant that market participants were rather gloomy about prospects for stock prices for some time to come.\n\nAs an example of how stock index futures actually work, the March 1982 contrast closed on Feb. 24 at 126.65, signifying a worth of $63,325. Last Thursday, reflecting the recent setback in stock prices, the same contract finished at 120.10, for a value of $60,050. Thus, the first-day buyer showed a loss, while the seller had a profit. If this contract were held until the March 31 settlement date and if it finished then at, say, 123, it would be worth $61,500.\n\nMeanwhile, a speculator might be trading various contract months in hopes of capitalizing on stock market swings. Stock index futures are simply the latest in a basketful of innovative futures. On various exchanges, there already has occurred trading in futures contracts for such varied instruments as Treasury bonds, leaded gasoline, foreign currencies and bank certificates of deposit.\n\nAs for trading stock index futures tied to other market indicators, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the futures industry, has received applications from the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Commodities Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange, which is a unit of the Big Board.",

        "instruction": "BEN LOMOND, Calif., Jan. 8— For the relatives and friends gathered here, the main task now is to keep hope from sliding away like the cascading mud that brought death and destruction to this mountain village in northern California. The death toll in Santa Cruz County from th e mud slides that followed this week's torrrential rains has ri sen to 11, according to the county sheriff's department. The worst de struction occurred in this community of 5,000 people perched in the redwood forests of the Santa Cruz Mountains, south of San Francisco.\n\nSheriff's officials said that from four to eight persons were still believed entombed in the wreckage of nine hillside houses. Most of the devastation occurred in a square-mile area about a mile northeast of the town, where professional loggers, assisted by neighbors and relatives, struggled in a search for additional survivors.\n\nThe evidence of the force of nature, unleashed by storms early this week that dumped up to 15 inches of rain on a 200-mile stretch of northern California, is still clearly visible. Three days after cleanup efforts began, the road from Santa Cruz, nine miles to the south, is still littered with boulders and debris from the mud slides. Water and Power Lacking\n\nDrinking water and electricity are still lacking. National Guard troops distributed plastic jugs of water brought from other parts of the state. Buildings that have their own generators were the only ones with power.\n\nDay after day, relatives and friends of those believed missing have passed long hours in several emergency shelters waiting for news that will mean pain or welcome relief.\n\nAt Ben Lomond's tiny fire station, the thoughts of more than a dozen people were directed toward a house where a search continued for Gene Rumw ill, 47 years old, and a friend, Vonna Blount, 32, who were believed unable to escape the mud slides that inundated a 100-year-old house on Woodland Road.\n\nA third resident of the house, Karen Wallingford, was hospitalized after she was thrown free by the force of the impact, Mr. Rumwill's family said. Waiting Out the Search\n\nErika Barrows, Mr. Rumwill's former wife, came down from Sacramento to wait out the search, bringing with her their three children. A daughter sat near her side. Two sons were digging in the ruins of the house, still trying to uncover what had been the bedrooms, Mrs. Barrows said.\n\n''I want to be with my boys when they find their father,'' she said. She said Mr. Rumwill was head of the Wilderness Studies in Sierra Institute at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Miss Blount, who was also a naturalist, had lived in the area all her life.\n\nAt one point this morning, Paul Ramm, captain of the volunteer fire force and local coordinator of the search, approached and beckoned for a word with Mrs. Barrows. The small comments that passed among the group to keep their spirits up halted.\n\n''Any news?'' one finally asked. Mrs. Barrows shook her head. ''Every time he comes into the room my heart leaps,'' she said quietly. Search Dogs and Chain Saws\n\nIn the mountains, the silence was broken by the barking of dogs and the roar of chain saws. Two rescue teams, each equipped with a pair of search dogs, combed the area. State workers joined with loggers recruited from two lumber companies to clear away trees felled by the mud slides and cut through the wrecked houses.\n\nHere and there, relatives of the missing walked toward the search area, wearing orange armbands to gain entrance past roadblocks. Sgt. Vince Hurley of the sheriff's department said it had taken all day to advance only 50 yards along Woodland Road through the tangle of fallen fir, redwood and eucalyptus trees.\n\nWendell Porter, a 32-year-old rock-music producer who lives in a rugged redwood lodge built on one of Woodland's highest points, took account today of what he described as minimal damage to his home: Part of the deck was torn away and the carport was demolished. Left Before the Rains Came\n\nMr. Porter, who has lived in the area five years, said he and three associates went out Monday night to get something to eat shortly before the rains became heavy, ''and the deputies on the road wouldn't let us drive back up.''\n\nOn both sides of the lodge, within a few feet of its walls, are wide gashes of mud that poured down from the hill, destroying several houses below. Just outside a rear bedroom window is a pile of downed trees that came to a halt so close to the house that the leaves of some brush the panes.\n\nMr. Porter said he had talked with the house's architect to determine what it would take to put the house back in shape to live and work in, for that is what he intends to d o.\n\n''We got off pretty well,'' he said. ''It's the people down there I feel bad about.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of rescue workers along Love Creek Road map of the pacific coast, showing areas hardest hit",

Most of the devastation occurred in a square-mile area about a mile northeast of the town, where professional loggers, assisted by neighbors and relatives, struggled in a search for additional survivors."

By DAVID TABACOFF\n\nWe arrived in Jogjakarta at dawn after a tiring 16-hour trip from Bali by bus and ferry. My wife, Sheri, and I had come to the town in central Java to visit its renowned batik factories and to see the ruins of a nearby Buddhist shrine called the Borobudur, described by some travelers as the Parthenon of the East. But all we wanted to do at that moment was to get some sleep.\n\nAs we stood on the street with our luggage, exhausted and anxious, someone spoke to us in English: ''What is your program?'' The questioner was a small, wiry bicycle-rickshaw driver. Our program? All we knew was that we wanted to find an inexpensive, but clean and comfortable, place to stay. ''I can take you there,'' the man said with assurance. After a few weeks in Asia, we were wary of such comeons, but we were so tired that we overcame our reluctance and piled our luggage and ourselves into his rickshaw and headed off.\n\nIt was still early morning, but the streets of Jogjakarta (or Jogja to its 400,000 residents) were filled with people on bicycles, their clanging bells creating a cacophony. There were few buses or taxis, and even fewer private cars. Instead, among the thousands of bicycles were hundreds of brightly painted bicycle-rickshaws. These vehicles, called becaks, do the work of taxis and can even serve as light pick-up trucks if the need arises; because of the fierce competition, their prices are, by our standards at least, preposterously low. Our driver struck a bargain before we had even arrived at our hotel - he would return and take us to all the major tourist sites in town for $2.\n\nWe were delivered to a guest house off Jogjakarta's main street, Marlioboro, named after the Duke of Marlborough (the British occupied Jogjakarta in 1814). Called the Peti Mas, or Gold Box, it was a modest two-story building with about 16 rooms, set back from the street behind a high white wall. The registration desk was set up in a central courtyard bright with potted plants and caged birds.\n\nWe were given a room with a private bathroom on the second floor for $12 a night. (The price also included a tray of sweets and tea waiting at our door every evening.) Although the room was not airconditioned, a small fan kept it sufficiently cool. Since this was Jogjakarta, the owners had also set up a small batik shop in a room on the ground floor.\n\nAfter we unpacked and took a short nap, we met our becak driver who pedaled us off to our first stop: the Kraton, or Sultan's Palace. The Kraton is actually a small city, surrounded by four walls, each about a half mile in length. Within the compound are batik schools, silversmiths, mosques and two museums, as well as the living quarters of the present Sultan and his family. (Although the sultanate of Jogjakarta originated in the native Javanese empire that ruled the island before the Dutch arrived at the end of the 16th century, the job of sultan is today largely ceremonial.)\n\nThe Kraton buildings, some of which date back to the 18th century, may be visited only with a guide, whose services cost about 25 cents. We found the buildings of the palace to be less than awe-inspiring, their white walls cracked and chipped with age. Our guide seemed less interested in the tour than we were. He rushed us past even the most impressive structures - among them the Bengsal Kencono, or Golden Pavilion, with its carved teak pillars - and through one museum with dust-covered photographs and portraits of the Sultan's family.\n\nThe guide soon left us to our own devices, and as we wandered through those parts of the grounds open to the public we came across a gamelan orchestra rehearsing. Gamelan music accompanies almost every cultural event in Java, from dance and drama performances through puppet shows; the orchestra is composed of gongs, drums and the gamelans themselves, instruments similar to xylophones of varying shapes and sizes. The players in this instance were elderly men, clad in the traditional garb of batik sarongs, white shirts and little batik turbans.\n\nOur next stop was Jalan Tirtodipuran, a narrow street with a dozen or so shops stocked with batik of the highest quality. Behind the showrooms are the courtyards where the craftsmen -each factory employs about 50 workers - turn out the batik.\n\nThe wax-resist dyeing process by which batik is made is intricate. The pattern is first transferred to a length of plain white cloth; it is either pencilled in (work usually done by women) or stamped on with a metal block (work usually done by men). The pattern is then retraced with wax poured through a thin, pencil-like object called a tulis. The the material is then dipped in dye, so that all parts of the cloth not covered with the wax absorb the dye. The pattern becomes more elaborate with each repetition of the process; the fabric is dipped in boiling water to remove the wax when a new color is introduced (the traditional colors for Javanese batiks are a range of browns and dark blues). After the proper design and color is achieved, the cloth is reboiled to remove all the wax.",

''They've done very well, very fast,'' says Miss Bunge, 17 years old, who is Swiss by birth, grew up in Peru, lives in Coral Gables, Fla., and has West German citizenship.\n\nToday, Miss Bunge will have an opportunity to improve her international computer ranking, now at 16. In a coin flip last night, she drew top-seeded Martina Navratilova in the opening semifinal match at noon in the $300,000 Avon Tennis Championships at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe coin toss was necessitated when Miss Bunge beat Leslie Allen, 6-1, 6-3. Earlier, Sylvia Hanika, Miss Bunge's West German Federation Cup teammate, dealt Hana Mandlikova of Czechoslovakia her second loss of the double elimination tournament, 1-6, 6-1, 6-0.\n\nSince the Misses Bunge and Hanika had already lost to Miss Jaeger in the five-day event, they flipped a coin to see who would draw Miss Navratilova. As Miss Bunge heard Lee Jackson, the referee, designate her as the winner of the toss, she playfully stuck out her tongue.\n\nMiss Bunge lost to Miss Navratilova, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, earlier this winter in the semifinals of an Avon tour event in Los Angeles. If she maintains enough mental tenacity to complement her sound strokes, Miss Bunge could join the Misses Austin and Jaeger as teen-agers trying to keep Miss Navratilova from regaining the No. 1 spot on the tour. Conventional Backhand\n\nUnlike the Austin-Jaeger duo, Miss Bunge has no two-handed backhand. But she is not intimidated at the prospect of volleying under fire, and her conventional backhand can be a devastating shot, cross court or down the line.\n\n''I've always had that shot,'' said Miss Bunge, whose initiation process has involved more learning of patience than of strokes. ''Because everything's working much better, it looks like it's new.''\n\nMiss Allen, in her third match, before a hometown crowd of 12,050, was disappointed in failing to play her best tennis. ''I think she was pretty nervous at the beginning, very nervous,'' Miss Bunge said.\n\nMiss Allen, 24 years old, won only 6 points in dropping the first four games. She was unable to control her first serve and failed to bend her knees enough on her service returns that failed. She was as close as a point for 4-4 in the second set, but she double-faulted and dropped her serve on two forehand cross-court winners by Miss Bunge. Miss Mandlikova Falters\n\nThe Hanika-Mandlikova match was mystifying on several levels. Miss Mandlikova won the first 14 points and was a set in front after only 17 minutes.\n\n''I knew she could not play like this for two hours,'' Miss Hanika said. ''So I tried to come back and destroy her rhythm.'' Miss Hanika, a left-hander with a deep serve and crisp ground strokes, played her way back into the match. The second set was over in 27 minutes, won by Miss Hanika, and it might have gone considerably swifter if the sixth game had not gone to eight deuces.\n\nIn the third set, Miss Mandlikova, a United States Open runner-up last summer, won only 2 of the first 16 points and 6 over all. The set lasted 16 minutes and the match 62 minutes.\n\nAsked whether she felt Miss Mandlikova had given up, Miss Hanika said, ''Yeah, maybe after 2-love in the third set she didn't try too hard.''\n\nNot so, Miss Mandlikova said. ''I look like I give up always because my style is easy,'' she said. ''But I'm trying every point.'' In the doubles semifinals last night, Miss Navratilova and Pam Shriver beat Sue Barker and Ann Kiyamura, 6-1, 6-4. Then Barbara Potter and Sharon Walsh defeated Rosie Casals and Wendy Turnbull, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3. The doubles final will be held today, after the two singles matches.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Bettina Bunge Photo of Sylvia Hanika",

He insisted both wayward balls were accidents.\n\nThe John McEnroe-like trouble began for Agassi in the fourth set, which Rafter would eventually win. Agassi felt two sideline calls by a linesman were unfair - even though replays showed the calls were correct - and asked that the linesman be moved.\n\n\"You've got plenty of people, get rid of him,\" Agassi said.\n\nUmpire Mike Morrissey moved the linesman to a different position - at the center, to judge whether serves land in or out.\n\nAgassi then let loose with a 122-mph serve - his hardest delivery of the day - that landed suspiciously long in the linesman's direction.\n\n\"I was trying to hit the line, and it just got a little bit away from me,\" Agassi insisted.\n\nIn the 13th game of the deciding fifth set, Agassi cursed aloud about another line call that went against him. A lineswoman overheard him, walked over to Morrissey, and tattled on Agassi.\n\nMorrissey then assessed an obscenity code violation against Agassi, who may face a fine today from Grand Slam committee members and the referee.\n\nThe incident seemed to shake Agassi's concentration. He lost the game on the next point, and the match in the next game.\n\nAfter the last point, Agassi walked to congratulate Rafter at the net. Suddenly the tennis star smacked a forehand at the lineswoman.\n\n\"I meant to hit the ball into the net,\" Agassi said, later characterizing the lineswoman as \"classless.\"\n\nAsked if he felt it was unfair that he received an obscenity code violation, Agassi said, \"Yeah, big-time.\" In an apparent bedroom insult, Agassi remarked, \"I blame her husband for that.\"\n\nAgassi, stung by defeat, was combative in his postmatch press conference. Asked about the quality of the match, which most observers regarded as brilliant, Agassi said, \"I thought it sucked. Really did.\"\n\nHe still won't talk about his defeat in May at the French Open, when he fell apart the moment former President Bill Clinton appeared in Paris to watch him.\n\nAgassi's tantrum was the second imbroglio involving U.S. players at Wimbledon; earlier this week, Jennifer Capriati accused Serena Williams of blaming every defeat on illness or injury.\n\nCapriati, who defeated Williams in the quarterfinals, was then upset in the semifinals by Justine Henin, who plays Serena's sister, Venus, in the finals today.",

        "instruction": "IBEGAN my life waiting for him. When other children asked, ''Where is your father?'' I had my mother's answer: ''He's fighting in the war.'' For the first four years of my childhood, I grew into the anticipation: My father would come home when the war ended. In the interim, my mother and I moved in a holding pattern - from one relative's apartment to another, sleeping on sofas and collapsible cots. In the dark of different living rooms, we traded questions and answers that were always the same: ''Did he see me before he left?'' ''Once. You were in your crib, sleeping.''\n\nHow could I have slept? I wondered at age 3. ''Couldn't I have been wakened?'' ''You were fast asleep.'' I progressed from litany to interrogation -there was something wrong. I quizzed my mother for details, dates. ''What did you wear to your wedding?'' ''A beige suit.'' ''Why not a white wedding dress?'' ''There wasn't time. He had to fly overseas.''\n\nOn national holidays, we hung a small flag out the window. At parades, we sang on the sidelines. My mother said my father had many medals, more ribbons than anyone and - this was my favorite part -his own fighting dog, a boxer named Butch, who was a gentle pet when he wasn't ripping apart the enemy. It was a red-white-and-blue story, told to the accompaniment of bugles. There was only one major flaw: While I waited for my hero soldier father to return from battle, this country was not at war.\n\nNo war. I got the message when I was 4. I rushed to tell my mother, who in 1951 assured me that World War II was not yet over. ''Most of the soldiers have come back,'' she confirmed, ''but there are still a few outposts that have to be captured.''\n\nWhile my father purportedly fought at his unnamed front, my mother and I lived in limbo. The interrogations continued: I collected information. His name was Larry. He was from Alabama. His hair was blond, his eyes blue. He was tall and handsome. He had met my mother in Miami, then been sent overseas. He could fly a plane, fire a machine gun.\n\nBy the time I was 4, I noticed my mother blush when ''Larry'' was mentioned. I began to blush, too, whenever anyone inquired about my father. When the Korean conflict began, my mother and I both relaxed. No one looked at us strangely and asked ''What war?'' any more.\n\nBut even Korea came to an end, and with it the first installment of my life without father. One afternoon, on a city street, as I demonstrated mock machine-gun fire - ''This is how my daddy kills them.'' - my mother tapped me on the shoulder and led me a discreet distance away from the other children. As we walked, she said I shouldn't tell that story anymore. I guessed the reason: ''The war's over.'' ''In a way it is.'' She told me Larry would not be marching home after all. His body was already buried ''overseas.'' I asked about the medals, the ribbons, perhaps his uniform? With a vividness of detail I can appreciate in retrospect, my mother explained why there was nothing left to be sent to us. ''He was blown up in tiny pieces.'' His uniform was burned, his medals melted, the ribbons charred and lost forever.\n\n''Butch?'' Was Butch riding in the tank? No, he was not. ''The Army needs dogs like Butch.'' Butch, I was told, had been reassigned. And so, it appeared, were my mother and I. No longer transient, we moved to our own ''efficiency'' apartment. We were no longer ladies in waiting, we were in mourning. My mother lit a memorial candle and placed it carefully in the corner of the bathtub, there to flicker in remembrance without becoming a fire hazard for 24 hours on each anniversary of my father's death.\n\nSuspicion flickered too: Why on the first day at school was I called to the office? ''Why is your last name different from your father's?'' I felt scalded. I didn't know. I said so, and felt as I still do sometimes that I was lying although I was telling the truth. By age 7, I was familiar with the sensation -that of being compressed into an upright, too-tight coffin - that accompanied any inquiries.\n\nI believe my mother would have told me more about my father, but she died when I was 8. Her two younger brothers raised me. Fatherless for my first eight years, I spent the next eight under the care of two loving men.\n\nWhen I asked my uncles for more information, they could not even verify the spelling of his last name. ''We just don't know.'' Hadn't they asked my mother? No, they said, they had not. They respected her privacy: It is a discreet family. My mother, a tall brunette with a memorable smile, was 35 when I was born. She made her own way, she made her own choice. It was only the time - 1947 - and tradition that forced her to create the fiction.\n\nGrown up, I exchanged one fantasy for another: My father was alive somewhere. I could find him. My only problem with the new fantasy was that I rebelled at its maudlin nature. I don't like melodrama: It's not my material. A thousand soap operas played in my own mind. I was always walking into my father's office, surprising him. Why did I have to wear all white and that slouch hat? Having seen too many B movies, I ran with what clues I had. To me ''the South'' meant ''Gone With the Wind'' or ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' I envisioned myself surprising my father on an antebellum porch, where we would soon fling ourselves into delicate frenzies of regret.\n\nWhat happened was not romantic or melodramatic - it was tedious. I wrote to the Hall of Records. My letter was returned, stamped ''INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION.'' I wrote again: How many Larry Moores could have been stationed in Miami in 1946? Too many, I was told. I would need the missing man's consent before his file could be released. Later requests to every imaginable authority were also denied. My father's name was ''too common.'' I would have to give up.\n\nI almost did. My efforts became erratic. I might not think of him for months, then see an out-of-state phone book and flip to his name. That was how I conducted my search - standing up, in fluorescent telephone ''communications centers.'' Uncertain even of the spelling, I worked the combinations: Moore, Lawrence; More, Laurence; even Mawr, Laurenz. I studied the listings: Larry Moore of Flat Creek Road? I could see Larry Moore: There his face seemed, brooding over bourbon, staring down at Flat Creek. I invented detailed scenarios - his wife walks onto the veranda, her hands holding an empty vase: ''Why, who's that, Larry?'' she asks. ''No one,'' he answers, his eyes meeting mine.\n\nI never had the nerve (or perhaps the need) to telephone any of the hundreds of Laurence/Larry/ Lawrence Moore/More/Mawrs. The closest I came was to draft a letter, to be copied ''Dear Laurence/ Larry/Lawrence, were you perhaps stationed in Miami in --?'' I explained that this was ''not an emotional matter,'' but simple curiosity on my part. There would be no unpleasant scenes. It was not a case of anguish, I wrote, then realized I had misspelled the word ''anquish.'' Squish.\n\nI never finished the letter, never copied it, never mailed it. Still the potential drama lurks never too distant at the back of my mind. Hope is sneaky. It hides behind reason. As recently as three years ago, I might pause at a ''communications center'' to flip under the M's in the book marked Alabama. Then I stopped. Just quit. I didn't want to do it any more: I wanted to come to terms with never knowing him.\n\nHis absence may have benefited me more than his presence: If my early life is a fiction, well, then, fiction is my trade. The truth I feel is something stronger. I was raised by two men who cared for me. I'm their child, not his. And I owe my existence not to him, but to my mother who risked more than usual to give me life. The ultimate revelation of being a love child is that it was my mother's love that made me. I am my mother's daughter. I am hers.",

And as he glided into Nobu, the post-modern Japanese restaurant in lower Manhattan that is a daily destination for perfectly pressed, unflappable corporate types, Stedman Graham was all facts and figures.\n\nThis is the same Stedman Graham who is known to television talk-show watchers (not to mention millions of People and Ebony magazine readers and supermarket-tabloid addicts) as Oprah Winfrey's longtime boyfriend. The athletic, 6-foot-6 man who has stood by the talk-show queen as she has gone from thick to thin. The man who was briefly engaged to her. The man who may or may not have objected to intimate parts of an autobiography, which she pulled in 1993 before it could be rushed into print. The man who overcame an angry childhood that left him as an adolescent and adult with cripplingly low self-esteem.\n\nHe was at Nobu for one of his favorite meals: sushi a la carte. Like his modular lunch of yellowtail and salmon rolls, Mr. Graham was carefully assembled, from his spit-polish size 15 loafers to his meticulously manicured fingernails.\n\nBut he was also there, for once, to talk. After years of being swallowed up in Ms. Winfrey's sizable shadow, Mr. Graham, who turns 46 next week, said he wanted the world to know that he is not just, as McCall's magazine recently put it, ''Mr. Oprah.''\n\nHe said more than once that he is his own man, with his own ideas and dreams. He is quick to remind anyone who appears unaware of it that he is the founder, president and chief operating officer of S. Graham & Associates, a management, marketing and consulting firm that specializes in sports. He shifted easily from topic to topic, from how men need not feel threatened by relationships with women who earn more than they do to his conviction that the chorus of those who say they speak for black America sorely needs new voices and new messages.\n\n''We have lost leadership in our African-American communities,'' he said. ''The old guard has not brought in any new players. They've closed out younger people who could take their places and create some opportunities and change the way we think and keep the movement going.''\n\nHe spoke passionately about what he sees as the failure of the black middle class to return to struggling inner-city neighborhoods and help people who still live there. ''No one would ever think that I think this way,'' Mr. Graham then remarked.\n\nHis opinions do not surprise Les Brown, the author and motivational speaker, who is also married to a woman better known than he, the recording star Gladys Knight. ''Stedman is a deep thinker, a guy who has special perceptions of things,'' said Mr. Brown, who has helped Mr. Graham sharpen his public speaking. ''He is a warm person and a guy who speaks from his heart.''\n\nThe newest of Mr. Graham's corporate hats seems to please him most. He is the president of the marketing firm Graham Gregory Bozell. Before lunch, Mr. Graham was listening to proposals by his staff at the company's headquarters on West 23d Street (his world spins on a double axis of New York, where Wall Street is, and Chicago, where Ms. Winfrey is). One presentation envisioned festivals to showcase African art, music, food, history and business opportunities. Another was for a sports resource center at George Washington University, where Mr. Graham directs sports seminars and is active in marketing.\n\n''We could change the whole culture of sports,'' Mr. Graham said. During the presentation he said quietly, ''exciting,'' ''great synergy.'' He attended Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Tex., on a basketball scholarship. On graduation with a Bachelor of Science in social work, disappointed not to be drafted by the National Basketball Association, he played in the 1970's in the European Basketball League, where, a publisher's biography states, ''he starred for several years.''\n\nAt lunchtime, he was talking about his public image. ''People didn't know anything about what I do or what I'm involved in,'' he said, sipping hot tea. ''They say, 'Wow, where did this guy come from?' ''\n\n''I'm stepping out,'' Mr. Graham said in a voice both gentle and insistent. ''I know there is going to be a backlash at some point,'' he added, noting that some people might have a problem with his having ''equal billing with one of the most powerful women in the world.'' In the eyes of some, Mr. Graham said, that would ''make me a dangerous man.''\n\nMr. Graham's beginnings were modest. He is the second son of a house painter and grew up in predominantly black Whitesboro, N.J. He is himself the divorced father of a daughter, Wendy Graham, 21. He said that he is determined to ''help other people to reach their full potential.'' If that means cultivating a better-known public persona, then Mr. Graham, who has a master's in education from Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., says he is ready.\n\nHe stepped into the spotlight this month when he became the face of the National Black Fine Art Show, a landmark gathering of black artists, dealers and art. Without Ms. Winfrey at his side (although she attended), Mr. Graham chatted with reporters, as television crews trailed him past watercolors, oils and sculptures. Graham Gregory Bozell was a sponsor of the three-day show at the Puck Building in SoHo.",

        "instruction": "In a new series called Off the Radar, LightBox asks celebrated photographers to write about image makers whose work they admire yet may be unknown to a wider audience. Here, Mark Steinmetz celebrates a group of women who documented life in the Northeastern United States in the 1980s.\n\nI would like to call attention to some remarkable photography made in the late 1970s and early 1980s by nine women in Massachusetts. Though not all of these women were aware of each other’s work at the time, they shared a love for the camera’s ability to describe the material complexity of the world and for the open grey tones of the black and white print. For the most part, they all championed the fluid use of a 4 x 5 view camera (even though this required a tripod) and they mixed flash in with daylight exposures so no deep shadows, no strong chiaroscuro, appeared in their prints. There are no large gestures or dramas here nor easy sentiment.\n\nThese artists tended to photograph their homes and their families as well as other private, largely middle-class spaces. Their interest in detailed realism and in the everyday reminds me of the ambitions of 17th-century Dutch masters; but theirs is an updated, unmistakably American realism, set in silver.\n\nMany of these women have a connection to the Massachusetts College of Art, where Nicholas Nixon taught, and also to the Yale School of Art, where Tod Papageorge and Richard Benson were on the faculty, and all of them have gone on to teach photography themselves. Some of the women have received Guggenheim grants and National Endowment for the Arts grants, and several were included in Peter Galassi’s “Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort” show at MoMA (1991) and in Aperture’s “Mothers and Daughters” exhibition (1987). Despite this recognition, they have not been widely included in the commercial gallery scene, and my guess is that young photographers today are probably not familiar with their names.\n\nThe work of Joan Albert, who died two years ago, certainly deserves to be brought to a wider audience, and I hope some young curator or critic will take up the cause. Her primary subject was her children at home in Cambridge, a project she began after she lost one son in an accident. Mary Frey, like many women in this group, cites Nicholas Nixon as an influence, but she also mentions Emmet Gowin, who is known for his poetic, romantic pictures of his wife and her family. The photos in her series, “Domestic Rituals” (1979-1983), seem quite naturalistic, but are in part staged by the photographer, and she avoids the temptation to romanticize.\n\nSage Sohier worked with a 6 x 9 cm camera (perhaps at the prompting of Tod Papageorge, who taught at Harvard before Yale), which can be hand-held and results in a trimmer rectangle than the 4 x 5. She went to different neighborhoods around Boston, primarily photographing groups of people, and made road trips throughout America. Like others in this group, she photographed domestic situations in interiors. Sohier cites Weegee as an influence for his use of flash in daylight, and also Chauncey Hare.\n\nJudith Black includes herself in her photographs of her four children and her partner. She uses 4 x 5 Polaroid materials and studied photography at MIT. Monika Andersson, Mary Tortorici, Cathy Griffin, and Lynn Whitney attended both MassArt and Yale.\n\nAndersson hails from Sweden and photographed her relatives there, as well as subjects in New England. Tortorici and Griffin now both teach in Appalachia, and like many of the photographers here, eventually switched to color. Tortorici’s photograph of shivering girls wrapped in towels is at the same time a subtle narrative and a keen description of a physical setting. Griffin’s photo of a cow, from a series on farm animals, is a phenomenological marvel. For her part, Lynn Whitney concentrated on members of groups, such as nuns and soldiers, whom are set apart from mainstream society. Sheron Rupp was the first among these women to adopt color photography, and yet she shares their common aesthetic.\n\nMore work from these remarkable photographers can be seen by clicking the following links: Sheron Rupp, Lynn Whitney, Judith Black, Mary Tortorici, Monika Andersson, Cathy Griffin, Sage Sohier and Joan Albert.\n\nMark Steinmetz is a Guggenheim fellow and his work is in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. His publications include South Central 2007, South East 2008, Greater Atlanta 2009 and Paris in my time 2013. His newest book on little league baseball, The Players, will be published in late 2014 by Nazraeli Press. See more of his work here and here.",

        "instruction": "WHAT book company published the most novels last year? There is no official scorecard, but St. Martin's Press, whose total output of 342 titles in 1980 included 164 works of fiction, thinks it holds the distinction. ''If I'm not mistaken,'' said Thomas J McCormack, president of St. Martin's, ''only one other publisher, Doubleday, does as many as 100 fiction titles in a year.''\n\nSt. Martin's publishes an occasional best-selling literary novelist, including Jerzy Kosinski, but the bulk of its fiction list is unabashedly commercial. About 60 percent of its novelists are British, and many of the Americans are mystery writers.\n\nThe typical St. Martin's novel probably sells fewer than 5,000 copies, and Mr. McCormack said that he has prevailed upon some authors whose books generally sell only a few thousand copies to accept royalties averaging about 7 1/2 percent on the first printing, rather than the traditional 10 percent. Otherwise, he said, it would probably be uneconomical to publish them at all.\n\nBut St. Martin's plans to print 80,000 copies of ''Trade Wind,'' the M.M. Kaye novel due this summer, and it schedules large press runs for such best-selling nonfiction authors as the British veterinarian James Herriot, whose new book of memoirs has brought $3.6 million in subsidiary rights.\n\n''At the beginning of the 1970's, people were telling me to cut back on the number of titles and get out of hard-cover fiction altogether,'' said Mr. McCormack, who joined the company in 1969, when its total number of titles was only 42. Instead, he has been increasing the numbers steadily.\n\n''People always say, 'Do few books but better books' - as if by some act of will you'll call better books in through the door, or as if you can be sure which will be successful,'' he said. ''Nobody has such perfect foresight. Take a book like 'House on Prague Street,' by Hanna Demetz. It's a very quiet novel about a little girl in Prague in World War II and under a stringent publishing policy you'd say it's too somber a theme to warrant signing it up. But it was very successful; it went to the Book-of-the-Month Club and to paperback for a good figure.''\n\nWhen the Macmillan Company of New York became independent of Macmillan & Company Ltd. in 1952, the American company transferred most of its backlist of books to St. Martin's Press, which was newly created in the United States by the Macmillan family of London. The name St. Martin's, incidentally, comes from St. Martin's Lane, long the home of the London Macmillan. Harold Macmillan, the former British Prime Minister, was named chairman of the St. Martin's board in the early 1960's and the Macmillan family is still the majority stockholder.\n\n''But we're not owned by the Macmillan company of London, and I take few books from them,'' said Mr. McCormack. ''That way they can offer books to other American publishers without editors thinking that St. Martin's already turned them down.'' He said the presence of so many British writers on the St. Martin's list is largely the result of the company's origins and the fact that, ''when you start with an author, you tend to get his subsequent books.''\n\nAfter Patrick White won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature, he set up an annual $10,000 award for the writer whose body of work made the most distinguished contribution to Australian literature. Two years ago the award was won by Randolph Stow, a native of Australia who studied Indonesian languages at Yale University and who has lived in Britain since 1960.\n\nIn May, the Taplinger Publishing Company will publish Mr. Stow's ''Visitants,'' a novel set in Papua New Guinea. It will be the fifth of his seven novels to be published in the United States and it came to Taplinger in a roundabout way.\n\n''I read an intriguing review of it in The Times Literary Supplement,'' said Roy E. Thomas, a Taplinger editor, ''so I wrote off to England for a copy of the book. The British publisher referred me to the American agent, Georges Borchardt, and we bought it. It's our main fiction title, and it just may bring the kind of recognition in this country now enjoyed by Patrick White and Thomas Keneally.''\n\nWhile for Mr. Thomas the book amounted to love at first sight, he thought it had to be presented somewhat differently to an American readership than it was to the British. Accordingly, the American edition is a half-inch taller and wider than the Secker & Warburg edition, it contains a contents page, it carries an author's note in the front of the book, rather than at the back, and the epigraph has been moved from the title page to the page preceding the prologue.\n\nThe book also sports a new jacket and Mr. Thomas rewrote the jacket copy to convey more of the mood and spirit of the book, which he describes as a novel of alienation and confrontation, without giving away important details of the story.\n\nFor years Taplinger specialized in nonfiction, particularly crafts and how-to books, but in recent years, under the presidency of Louis Strick, it has published a number of translations of novels from Israel, South Africa, the Soviet Union and elsewhere. It recently published ''The Sea and Poison,'' the fourth novel by Shusaku Endo, an important Japanese writer.\n\nBut the company is particularly pleased about having Mr. Stow on its list, so much so that it plans to produce a revised edition of his first novel, ''To the Islands,'' published in 1959, when the author was 23 years old.\n\nThe New York Public Library's rare-books division holds about 10 major exhibitions a year of books from important small or private presses, and through April it is featuring what is considered to be one of its most beautiful exhibitions ever: the 29 limited edition volumes published by the Plain Wrapper Press, together with original manuscripts, artists' renderings and authors' correspondence.\n\nThe press began 15 years ago in Quito, Ecuador, when Richard-Gabriel Rummonds, a native Californian, printed two books for his friends in brown paper wrappers. Soon after, he moved to Verona, Italy, and began teaming up with Alessandro Zanella.\n\n''I moved to Verona because it's known as the center for hand printing,'' said Mr. Rummonds during a recent visit to New York. But instead of plain wrappers, the books are bound in leather, are hand printed and cost anywhere from $56 to $2,500. Most are sold to libraries and private collectiors.\n\nThe authors were paid a flat fee, and the collection includes poems or stories by Jorge Luis Borges (with blind-embossed impressions in the text and three gold-plated bronze bas reliefs on the cover by Arnaldo Pomodoro), Anthony Burgess (screenprints by Joe Tilson), Brendan Gill (title page ornament and patterned cover papers by Fulvio Testa) and Paul Zweig (etchings by Berta Moltke). ''Since we print only three or four titles a year, we try to print authors we're interested in,'' said Mr. Rummonds. The partners still do most of the work themselves, although they occasionally employ apprentices.\n\nThe Plain Wrapper Press display is in the second floor gallery of the central building, Fifth Avenue and 42d Street, from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. on Fridays and Saturday.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Thomas J.

        "instruction": "One of the chief weaknesses of the United Nations is its inability to enforce its reolutions even when those resolutions are backed by decisions of the International Court of Justice. The reason for this helplessness is what many nations at the U.N. call an ''abuse of the veto power.''\n\nAn abuse of the veto power occurred last year in the case of the 52 Americans who were held hostage in Iran. The Security Council adopted a resolution requesting the release of the American hostages. This resolution was backed by a unanimous decision of the International Court of Justice. But sanctions to enforce that decision against Iran were vetoed by the Soviet Union.\n\nAn abuse of the veto power occurred this year in the case of Namibia, which has been held hostage by South Africa ever since World War II. The Security Council has repeatedly adopted resolutions asking South Africa to release Namibia from its military control. The International Court of Justice, in an advisory opinion in 1971, held that South Africa had no legal authority to remain in Namibia and should turn that former League of Nations mandate over to the United Nations. Sanctions to enforce that decision were again vetoed by the United States, Great Britain and France on April 30.\n\nThe repeated abuse of the veto power is one of several reasons why the United Nations is no longer held in respect in many quarters. The Campaign for U.N. Reform advocates a modification of the veto in return for some form of weighted voting to replace the inequitable one-nation, one-vote system in the General Assembly. One way to modify the veto would be to prohibit its application to the imposition of sanctions when the Security Council is being asked to enforce a decision of the International Court of Justice.\n\nAmbassador Kirkpatrick says that sanctions are not effective and cites the history of Rhodesia in the 1970's. Certainly they are ineffective if large nations do not comply with the sanctions. In the 1970's, the U.S. Congress adopted the Byrd Amendment, which directed the Administration not to comply with the U.N. sanctions on Rhodesia. That amendment was finally removed, and Rhodesia was persuaded in time to allow free elections in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe issue is not the effectiveness of sanctions. The issue is, How can opinions of the International Court of Justice be enforced? If the force of world opinion fails to bring about compliance, economic sanctions are the only practicable way to insure respect for the decisions of the International Court. To impose such sanctions, however, it is evident that the abuse of the veto by the major powers must be contained. WALTER HOFFMANN, National Chairman, Campaign for U.N. Reform Wayne, N.J., May 1, 1981",

The pluck-pluck rhythms, woozy cornet blasts, and LaFarge’s Midwestern croon are evocative of a trip down the Mississippi, and have been dubbed “riverboat chic.”\n\nBut dig a little deeper and LaFarge’s music is hardly a museum-quality re-creation; it’s as much a mongrel as anything you’d consider truly American. Jazz, blues, and country collide in LaFarge’s music. He trades purity for alchemy and ends up with something that is ultimately contemporary.\n\n“I’m an evolutionary musician,” says LaFarge when reached by phone while traveling through East Tennessee on a tour that brings his band to Boston on Saturday. “I learned my roots, but want to be my own person. I’m not trying to copy anybody. But it’s important to evolve through preservation.”\n\nLaFarge says that in his teens he listened to a lot of the same sorts of classic rock most kids latch onto, but once he discovered the blues, he became far more interested in that. As he studied more styles of traditional music, he was left to wonder why so few of his generation were as enthusiastic as he was about roots music.\n\n“I found out who I am through my curiosity,” he says. “Through music, I learned about my country, and I learned about people.”\n\nBut what he’s seen among his peers is either a complete rejection of the past or ambivalence toward it.\n\n“I’m in my 30s. A lot of people my age are not listening to older music. It’s like they are ashamed of the past. I talk up the great things this country has to offer. There is a diversity to be proud of,” he says, and targets what he considers one of the problems: “Corporations are running the country and telling us what our culture is.’’\n\nLaFarge says he is most popular in the working-class venues he plays in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.\n\n“I relate to people there and my music goes over better there than in other places,” he says.\n\nOne shock to the system of the St. Louis musician was seeing how the South is producing a fraction of the traditional music it once did.\n\n“There’s just a lot of crappy pop country music being made in places that used to put out such good music,” he says.\n\nLaFarge sets aside polemics in his music and instead tells stories, about good times and bad times, that touch upon the American character.\n\nFor example, his new self-titled record opens with “Central Time,” a cheery ode to no-coast dwellers. There are songs about summer in the city, Kentucky sweethearts, and the devil’s temptations.\n\nAs Caitlin Rose, who provided harmony vocals for two songs on LaFarge’s new album, says, “I’m not into the idea of throwbacks, and I don’t think he is. He is so much more genuine than that.”\n\nRose calls LaFarge a “born entertainer,” and his live shows certainly spread his appeal among a grassroots network of music fans. This year, LaFarge is drawing even more attention. He has performed on an album by and opened concerts for Jack White, whose Third Man Records released LaFarge’s album. This week LaFarge performed on the “Late Show With David Letterman.” One of LaFarge’s songs made it onto the “Lone Ranger” soundtrack, and he and members of his band landed a cameo in the film.\n\nLaFarge says this album, which follows the acclaimed “Middle of Everywhere” and “Riverboat Soul” records, is his most crafted to date. Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show co-produced the record, and LaFarge says it was the first time he spent more than two days in the studio working on a project.\n\n“Having Ketch there was great. He knows me and he knows my music,” LaFarge says. “He wasn’t always right, but he inspired me.”\n\nAnd even though LaFarge spent more time taking advantage of the studio, he did not derail the easy feel of his earlier work. If anything, the use of strings, clarinet, and piano simply add nuance to LaFarge’s music.\n\n“Songs should be natural. Some may take five minutes to write, most take longer, but it doesn’t matter as long as it sounds natural,” he says.\n\nSongwriting to this point, LaFarge says, has been about learning about himself and the world around him. Moving forward, he wants to write more songs that add commentary to the mix.\n\n“I look forward to being more socially conscious in songs,” he says. “There are a lot of things that need to be talked about.”",

Nabel says the hospital must be prepared to compete for patients.\n\nAt the same time, Brigham and Women’s has begun an initiative aimed at reducing annual expenses by about 10 percent - twice as much as the target set for the hospital by its corporate parent, Partners HealthCare System Inc.\n\nThe cost-cutting steps range from consolidating vendors and temporary hiring agencies to monitoring the use of towels, sheets, and blankets. So far, the hospital said, there have been no layoffs, though some workers have been shifted to new positions.\n\n“There’s a thousand opportunities to make better use of our resources,’’ Brigham and Women’s president Elizabeth G. Nabel said. Hospital executives want to be aggressive in weeding out excess costs to set an example, Nabel said, and to make sure Brigham and Women’s doesn’t lose patients to rivals that charge less for care.\n\nHospital employees are scheduled to hear about the moves today at a “town meeting’’ hosted by Nabel, who took the top job two years ago after running the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a major National Institutes of Health lab in Bethesda, Md. At the meeting, she will also unveil a strategic plan that calls for shifting the hospital’s emphasis from providing “episodic care’’ to managing patients’ health throughout their lives.\n\nHundreds of Brigham and Women’s 15,000 employees took part in drawing up the plan, which seeks to lay out the hospital’s goals and challenges in the context of changes sweeping the health care industry. It envisions a more coordinated, team-based approach to delivering health care, as well as state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nA central part of the strategy is the proposed 12-story “Brigham Building of the Future.’’ It would be built on a vacant Fenwood Road lot and house clinical and research operations for such areas as neuroscience, immunology, genomics, and regenerative medicine. The 350,000-square-foot building - connected by a walkway to the hospital’s Shapiro Cardiovascular Center - would also include 400 parking spaces on two or three underground levels. The hospital hopes to break ground in 2013 and complete the project in 2016.\n\n“Brigham Green,’’ the name of the hospital’s project to restore the old Francis Street common near Huntington Avenue, would add another 400 underground parking spaces. The green itself would feature a rose garden and vegetable garden, hospital officials said, and is expected to be finished in 2014.\n\nBoth projects - which require Boston Redevelopment Authority approval - would be funded through a mix of debt financing and donations.\n\nNabel, a cardiologist and clinical researcher who trained at Brigham and Women’s in the 1980s, said she had not anticipated that reducing expenses would become a major focus of her job as president of the hospital, one of the nation’s top recipients of NIH grants. “As a physician, I had never been thinking of cost and efficiency,’’ she said.\n\nNow, as hospitals move toward better coordination of medical treatment, Brigham and Women’s has been sending more patients to affiliated community hospitals for routine care while more complex and costly care is provided at the Boston campus. It also has embraced a system of “global payments,’’ under which doctors are given annual budgets for individual patients’ care instead of billing for each visit or procedure.\n\nNabel, a member of the governing board of the new national Health Care Cost Institute, said the next generation of doctors must be trained in meeting budgets and boosting efficiency as well as providing medical treatments.\n\nBrigham and Women’s, like its sister Partners institution Massachusetts General Hospital, commands some of the most generous health insurance reimbursements in the state, according to data collected by the Massachusetts attorney general’s office.\n\nBut being a highly paid hospital has some drawbacks at a time when new “tiered’’ insurance plans are channeling patients toward lower-cost medical centers. Brigham and Women’s suffered a blow early last year when Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, the state’s largest independent doctors group, began sending many of its Boston patients to rival Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in a bid to reduce health care costs.\n\n“This was an affordability issue,’’ Nabel said. She noted, however, that Brigham and Women’s has been able to keep many Harvard Vanguard patients and its overall business volume has remained stable.\n\nStill, Brigham and Women’s strategic plan warns that the hospital is vulnerable to losing patients to competitors if it can’t trim spending and make better use of its other facilities, which include Faulkner Hospital in Jamaica Plain, an ambulatory care center in Chestnut Hill, and a health care center in Foxborough.\n\nAs part of its community service mission, the hospital also will expand its Division of Health Equity, which staffs hospitals in poor countries such as Haiti and Rwanda with Brigham and Women’s doctors.\n\nNabel said the program could potentially double its current corps of 40 physicians, who spend part of the year working in Boston and the rest overseas. Brigham and Women’s recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Rwanda to allow the hospital and Harvard Medical School to provide medical education to the country’s doctors for the next seven years.\n\n“I view this as a modern-day Peace Corps,’’ Nabel said. “These individuals are totally committed to social justice and the belief that health care is a right.’’",

        "instruction": "THE anthropologist Oscar Lewis died of a heart attack at 55 in December 1970 while he was in New York doing research on poor Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Mr. Lewis, who wrote ''The Children of Sanchez'' and other well-known studies of slum families, had been ill with heart trouble earlier that year. But a recent book by an American professor in Canada, Maurice Halperin, contends that the government of Fidel Castro contributed to Mr. Lewis's death when it ''doublecrossed'' him by closing Project Cuba, his research into the transformation of Cuban society under a revolutionary government, and confiscating the project's files in June 1970.\n\nRuth Lewis, Mr. Lewis's widow, said, ''I wouldn't go so far as to say that Fidel Castro caused my husband's death.'' However, she added that she generally agrees with Professor Halperin's account, including his charge that Mr. Castro ''doublecrossed'' her husband.\n\n''Of the several Western scholars and journalists who at one time or another had a personal relationship with Fidel Castro, none paid a greater penalty than Oscar Lewis,'' Professor Halperin writes in ''The Taming of Fidel Castro,'' published recently by the University of California Press. Most of the book offers a critical analysis of Cuba and of Mr. Castro, whom it accuses of evolving from a charismatic revolutionary to a Soviet-dependent head of state. But one chapter is devoted to Mr. Lewis and to Project Cuba, which was terminated after about one and a half years of work.\n\nProfessor Halperin, professor emeritus of political science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B. C., knew Mr. Lewis and had first-hand knowledge of the Castro Government. From 1962 to 1968, he lectured at the University of Havana and was a consultant to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade. He went to Cuba at the invitation of Che Guevara, whom he met in Moscow. Professor Halperin, who fled the United States in 1953 after he was accused by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. of having been a member of the Communist Party and having passed secrets to Soviet agents, was a visiting professor at the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences for three years before going to Cuba. Matter of Interpretation\n\nIt is all a matter of interpretation, said Mrs. Lewis, a research associate in anthropology at the University of Illinois who assisted her husband in much of his field work in Cuba and elsewhere. ''The whole incident in Cuba affected my husband very deeply,'' she said in a telephone conversation. ''He took it personally and was brokenhearted, and I don't believe he was ever the same again. I would say the circumstances aggravated his condition.'' She added that when she and her husband departed Cuba a few days later, a concerned Fidel Castro sent a doctor to the airport to check on his condition.\n\nMrs. Lewis also disputed Professor Halperin's account of what happened when Mr. Lewis was summoned on June 25, 1970, to appear before Dr. Raul Roa, Cuba's Foreign Minister, in Havana. At that meeting Mr. Lewis was formally notified that Project Cuba had been suspended. (Two years later Raul Castro Ruz, Minister of the Armed Forces and Fidel's brother, portrayed Mr. Lewis as having been an American secret agent.)\n\n''At the moment when Roa finished reading the indictment,'' Professor Halperin wrote, ''Oscar suffered a heart attack and collapsed.'' He added that Mrs. Lewis failed to mention the heart attack in her foreword to ''Four Men,'' the first of three volumes based on some 20,000 pages of transcripts collected by the Lewises that had been taken out of Cuba before Project Cuba was halted. ''Ruth's efforts to account for their misfortune are less than satisfactory - in part, it would appear, because of an unwillingness to shed some of the naivete about socialism in general, and Castro in particular, that had led Oscar into the fatal trap,'' he wrote.\n\n''His chest pain was not a heart attack but angina, from which my husband had suffered for five years,'' Mrs. Lewis said. ''He did not have his nitroglycerin with him and they had to send out for some, but he did not need hospitalization.'' She said that she originally put that incident in ''Four Men'' but then removed it when she decided it was irrelevant. ''It seemed to be making a bid for sympathy,'' she said.\n\nAs for their alleged naivete toward socialism, Mrs. Lewis said: ''I don't know if it was naivete at the time. We felt hopeful and sympathetic about possibilities of improved life in Cuba. We went with an open mind, we wanted to believe the best. We hoped it would work out for the good of the Cuban people. But in the research we took a totally social-science position, and in writing up the material I tried not to inject personal views.'' Scholarly Integrity\n\nProfessor Halperin likewise praises Mr. Lewis's scholarliness, saying that when the anthropologist began to accumulate critical data about the Castro Government, ''his integrity as a scholar prevailed over any other consideration'' and ''he continued to do whatever was possible to meet his commitment to professional probity.''",

Suitably updated, this applies perfectly to the movement against globalization -- the movement that made its big splash in Seattle back in 1999 and is doing its best to disrupt the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City this weekend.\n\nThe facts of globalization are not always pretty. If you buy a product made in a third-world country, it was produced by workers who are paid incredibly little by Western standards and probably work under awful conditions. Anyone who is not bothered by those facts, at least some of the time, has no heart.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the demonstrators are right. On the contrary: anyone who thinks that the answer to world poverty is simple outrage against global trade has no head -- or chooses not to use it. The anti-globalization movement already has a remarkable track record of hurting the very people and causes it claims to champion.\n\nThe most spectacular example was last year's election. You might say that because people with no heads indulged their idealism by voting for Ralph Nader, people with no hearts are running the world's most powerful nation.\n\nEven when political action doesn't backfire, when the movement gets what it wants, the effects are often startlingly malign. For example, could anything be worse than having children work in sweatshops? Alas, yes. In 1993, child workers in Bangladesh were found to be producing clothing for Wal-Mart, and Senator Tom Harkin proposed legislation banning imports from countries employing underage workers. The direct result was that Bangladeshi textile factories stopped employing children. But did the children go back to school? Did they return to happy homes? Not according to Oxfam, which found that the displaced child workers ended up in even worse jobs, or on the streets -- and that a significant number were forced into prostitution.\n\nThe point is that third-world countries aren't poor because their export workers earn low wages; it's the other way around. Because the countries are poor, even what look to us like bad jobs at bad wages are almost always much better than the alternatives: millions of Mexicans are migrating to the north of the country to take the low-wage export jobs that outrage opponents of Nafta. And those jobs wouldn't exist if the wages were much higher: the same factors that make poor countries poor -- low productivity, bad infrastructure, general social disorganization -- mean that such countries can compete on world markets only if they pay wages much lower than those paid in the West.\n\nOf course, opponents of globalization have heard this argument, and they have answers. At a conference last week I heard paeans to the superiority of traditional rural lifestyles over modern, urban life -- a claim that not only flies in the face of the clear fact that many peasants flee to urban jobs as soon as they can, but that (it seems to me) has a disagreeable element of cultural condescension, especially given the overwhelming preponderance of white faces in the crowds of demonstrators. (Would you want to live in a pre-industrial village?) I also heard claims that rural poverty in the third world is mainly the fault of multinational corporations -- which is just plain wrong, but is a convenient belief if you want to think of globalization as an unmitigated evil.\n\nThe most sophisticated answer was that the movement doesn't want to stop exports -- it just wants better working conditions and higher wages.\n\nBut it's not a serious position. Third-world countries desperately need their export industries -- they cannot retreat to an imaginary rural Arcadia. They can't have those export industries unless they are allowed to sell goods produced under conditions that Westerners find appalling, by workers who receive very low wages. And that's a fact the anti-globalization activists refuse to accept.\n\nSo who are the bad guys? The activists are getting the images they wanted from Quebec City: leaders sitting inside their fortified enclosure, with thousands of police protecting them from the outraged masses outside. But images can deceive. Many of the people inside that chain-link fence are sincerely trying to help the world's poor. And the people outside the fence, whatever their intentions, are doing their best to make the poor even poorer.",

They have now been assembled, edited and supplemented in excellent fashion by the English expert Terence Reese. One of the Best Tips\n\nReese's own tip is one of the best of the collection. He invites players to study the early discards and consider the holdings from which they would have readily been discarded.\n\nFor example, a player holding A-5-3-2 or K-5-3-2 can spare a small card, but a player with Q-5-3-2 or J-5-3-2 would look for a discard somewhere else.\n\nIn the diagramed deal, from the book, Reese discusses the play in three no-trump. The defense takes the first four tricks in hearts, and East makes the normal discard of a spade.\n\nWest shifts to a diamond and South can see eight tricks. He wins in his hand, cashes the spade ace, and plays his remaining winners in diamonds and spades. He now has to guess what to do in clubs at the 12th trick.\n\nEast's early spade discard suggests that he had five cards in that suit, so his original distribution must have been 5-3-3-2 in that order. South plays for the drop and makes his game.\n\nIn the replay, in a hypothetical team match, East defends cleverly. His discard on the fourth heart is a diamond, and he eventually gives up a spade on the third round of diamonds.\n\nThis is very likely to fool an expert South, who will find himself in this ending: NORTH S 8 H - D - C K 7 WEST EAST S - S 9 H - H - D 10 D - C Q 5 C 10 9 SOUTH S - H - D - C A J 8\n\nWhen he cashes the club king and leads the five from dummy, South must guess.

        "instruction": "THE VERY CONCEPT OF \"VICTIM ART\" IS an appalling one. Only a sensibility unwilling to attribute full humanity to persons who have suffered injury, illness or injustice could have invented such a crude and reductive label.\n\nThere is a long and honorable tradition of art that \"bears witness\" to human suffering, but this is not \"victim art\" as the current term would have it, still less an art that manipulates or intimidates its audience to any perverse degree. (Doesn't all art, especially the conventional and pleasing, have the goal of affecting an audience's emotions?) That a human being has been \"victimized\" does not reduce his or her humanity but may in fact amplify it.\n\nThis issue, with its many political implications, has emerged most recently in the maelstrom of response to an article in The New Yorker by the magazine's veteran dance critic, Arlene Croce, on Bill T. Jones's dance \"Still/Here.\" \"Discussing the Undiscussable\" was the paradoxical title of the article, which began, \"I have not seen Bill T. Jones's 'Still/Here' and have no plans to review it.\"\n\nMs. Croce's main objection was that \"Still/Here\" integrated videotapes and audiotapes of AIDS and cancer victims in a dramatic dance work and that the presence of terminally ill \"real\" persons in the program rendered it, for her, \"beyond criticism.\" It was, to her, a prime example of \"victim art\" -- a \"raw art . . . deadly in its power over the human conscience\" and part of a larger \"pathology in art\" that seeks to manipulate audiences' feelings of sympathy, pity, intimidation and terror.\n\nBy the end of her essay, which appeared in the magazine's Dec. 26/Jan. 2 issue, Ms. Croce had lashed out indiscriminately at \"issue-oriented\" art (a thinly veiled slap at Tony Kushner's AIDS epic \"Angels in America\") and all \"mass-produced art of the 20th century\" (encompassing not only commercial television but the \"grisly\" Holocaust film \"Schindler's List\"); she acknowledged her resentment at being \"forced\" to feel sorry for \"dissed blacks, abused women [ and ] disfranchised homosexuals.\"\n\nFor her, this \"pathology in art\" began with the anarchic freedoms of the 1960's (anti-Vietnam War protest, blacks' and women's rights agitation) and flourished in the 80's, when hitherto marginalized ethnic-minority and gay Americans began to win grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and other institutions for their creative work.\n\nFrom the start, Bill T. Jones was perceived as a threat, a radical black/gay artist who seemed peculiarly immune to harsh criticism from Establishment voices. (\"When I blasted an early work of his with the phrase 'fevered swamps,' he retaliated by using the phrase as the title of a piece,\" Ms. Croce complained.)\n\nResponse to \"Discussing the Undiscussable\" was immediate and vociferous: an outpouring of letters to The New Yorker, both pro and con; columns and editorials in the news magazines, The Village Voice and elsewhere, and a renewed, embittered debate between conservatives and liberals about the changing nature of art. As with the Mapplethorpe obscenity trial of several years ago, the article has raised crucial questions about esthetics and morality, about the role of politics in art and about the role of the professional critic in assessing art that integrates \"real\" people and events in an esthetic framework.\n\nWhy should authentic experience, in art, render it \"beyond criticism\"? Consider great memoirist work like Dostoyevsky's \"House of the Dead,\" American slave narratives by ex-slaves like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, the witness-bearing testimonies of the Holocaust survivors Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, Aharon Appelfeld and Tadeusz Borowski, and poetry by Nelly Sachs and Paul Celan among many others.\n\n\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\" by the young Dutch Jew who died in Bergen-Belsen in 1945, is hardly the document of a mere victim, any more than the powerful elegy \"The Ship of Death,\" D. H. Lawrence's last poem, written on his deathbed, is.\n\nWe have poems of psychic disintegration by Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson and Sylvia Plath that are nonetheless poems of transfiguration. We have certain of Dorothea Lang's photographs -- \"Damaged Child,\" for instance; Walker Evans's portraits of tragically exhausted migrant workers; the strange, isolated, painfully human subjects of Diane Arbus; the Buchenwald photographs of Margaret Bourke-White, who considered herself a witness, an emissary. \"To understand another human being you must gain some insight into the conditions that made him what he is,\" she said.\n\nConsider the graphic depictions of the oppressed by Goya and Hogarth and Kathe Kollwitz, the lyric tenderness of Edvard Munch's \"Sick Child\" and \"Spring,\" which depict the artist's dying young sister. There are tortured self-portraits by Egon Schiele, Frida Kahlo, Francis Bacon. There are heart-rendingly powerful works of drama -- Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" Tennessee Williams's \"Streetcar Named Desire,\" Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,\" Sam Shephard's \"Buried Child,\" Marsha Norman's \" 'Night, Mother,\" Scott McPherson's \"Marvin's Room,\" among notable others, that deal with extremes of emotional distress -- but how imaginatively, and how differently from one another!",

        "instruction": "WITH cold days behind us, now is the time to consider the cleaning and storage of that comforter that has served so well. Whether comforters are filled with goose down, lamb's wool or polyester fiberfill, their owners should be aware of the advantages and pitfalls of cleaning. With the rising cost of materials, a comforter damaged by improper care would be expensive to replace.\n\nSo, what's a consumer to do? The first rule of thumb is to check the care tag on the item. Though down is washable, a comforter casing may not be and could stretch, shrink, fade or run. A satin casing, for instance, would be ruined if washed.\n\nPolyester fiberfill comforters can be washed or dry cleaned. Those filled with lambs wool should only be dry cleaned, which could cost from $11 to $15 for a king-sized comforter.\n\nBy its very nature, goose down, the soft undercovering of the waterfowl, is washable and most down comforters can be machine laundered in mild soap. A commercial, front-loading washer is recommended because the agitator in a top-loading machine can damage the fabric. The machine, set on gentle cycle, should be large enough to accomodate the comforter.\n\nAfter washing, the comforter should be thoroughly rinsed and then dried for several hours at low - or no -heat. A clean tennis sneaker or tennis ball thrown into the dryer will keep the down from shifting. A towel also tossed in will prevent the comforter from settling on the sides of the dryer, lessening the chance of burns. Complete drying is crucial, for mildew can grow on damp down. In addition, dampness flattens down, limiting its ability to trap and retain warmed air, the principal behind down warmth.\n\nA large comforter can be washed in a bathtub, but it can become unwieldy when wet. The comforter should not be hung on a line to dry, for the down can settle on the bottom.\n\nStan Salmirs, a marketing executive with Northern Feather, makers of the Dyne comforter, said his company recommends dry cleaning even for their washable comforters.\n\n''However, once or twice a month the comforter should be put into a dryer to rejuvenate it,'' said Mr. Salmirs. Publicity about the effects of various cleaning solvents on down has ruffled feathers within the industry during the last few years, confusing consumers in its wake.\n\nMost dry cleaners use perchloroethylene, a chlorinated solvent, to clean down and other products. Some cleaners, who claim the solvent can damage down, use petroleum solvents, which are extremely volatile and can be applied only in specially zoned areas. In New York City, few dry cleaners are situated in such areas; most are found in the suburbs.\n\nThree years ago, tests were done at the International Fabric Care Institute in Silver Spring, Md., with several kinds of down comforters. They were cleaned in various solvents, as well as by hand and in machines. The findings?\n\n''You can clean down in any solvent. None of the solvents will hurt the down or the construction of the fabric,'' said Norman Oehlke, director of consumer relations at the institute, an international laundry and dry-cleaning trade association founded in 1916.\n\nAlthough the institute prefers the dry cleaning of down - ''a drycleaned item looks better than a washed item; it's fuller and fluffier'' - Mr. Oehlke said the cleaning was dependent on the kinds of materials and stains involved.\n\n''If the instructions say dry clean, you should dry clean; if there are no instructions, we would recommend washing,'' said Howard C. Winslow, executive director of the Feather and Down Association, an international organization of suppliers of bulk plumage and manufactured down goods.\n\n''Dry cleaning is your best bet,'' said Sally Moore of the publicinformation department for Consumer Reports, which ran tests on down items in 1972 and 1981. She recommended that the dry-cleaned comforter be aired, to rid it of the solvent's odor.\n\n''A down comforter can be washed or dry cleaned,'' said Ronald Pacheco, vice president and technical director of the Better Fabrics Testing Bureau, an independent laboratory located in midtown Manhattan. ''It costs more to dry clean it.'' A random sampling of cleaners in New York City yielded prices from $11 to $24 for cleaning a king-size comforter.\n\nAfter cleaning, the comforter should be wrapped loosely in a sheet or pillowcase and stored in a box, or elsewhere, out of direct light that may fade the fabric. Plastic coverings should be avoided because the down must breathe. The comforter should be kept away from any hot source of light, such as an overhead bulb in a closet. Contact can result in burns.\n\nTo avoid the cleaning of down comforters, a washable cover can be used. Cotton or cotton-blend covers are available at department stores for prices ranging from $50 to $70. Or one can be made by sewing together two sheets, attaching fasteners to both the comforter and cover and installing a zipper or pieces of Velcro along the opening. Down East, a dry cleaning and repair business at 93 Spring Street, will make covers for $20 out of any material provided.",

In addition, one official said, many operational decisions were yet to be made because of the ''dynamic situation'' in the region.\n\nThe military construction budget prepared by the Carter Administration for 1981 and slightly enlarged by the Reagan Administration calls for spending about $270 million, with some construction already under way and many contracts waiting to be signed as soon as Congress approves.\n\nFor the 1982 fiscal year, which begins in October, the Carter Administration proposed $367.4 million for the bases, a figure that the new Administration raised this week to $472.6 million. That does not include other funds for bases in Europe and the Azores that back up those in the region around the Persian Gulf. Part of Overall Strategy\n\nThe construction plan was drawn up last year by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as part of a comprehensive strategy for the United States Navy and Rapid Deployment Force in the region. It was reviewed by Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger immediately after he took office in January and enlarged this week.\n\nUnited States forces will have periodic access to the string of bases under agreements with governments in the area but will not be able to station forces there permanently. All improvements made to the bases at United States expense, moreover, will become the property of the host nation.\n\nA large expenditure scheduled for 1982 would be $106.4 million to improve the Egyptian port and military base at Ras Banas, on the Red Sea opposite an important oil terminal in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe plan calls for construction of oil storage tanks and other shelter for supplies for naval forces; for expanding runways and aprons to accommodate jet fighters and military air transports, and for an austere staging area for ground troops that might be dispatched elsewhere in the region. Work on Old British Base\n\nA second large project, costing $75 million, would be the reconstruction of an old British base on the island of Masira off the coast of Oman. That, too, would include oil storage and other fleet support facilities, the refurbishing of the airfield to take tactical aircraft, and support facilities such as a water desalinization plant.\n\nSmaller programs in Oman would include improvements in the smaller airfield at Seeb, near the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz, to accommodate air transports, fighter planes, and surveillance planes that scout for Soviet submarines in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe long-range plan calls for spending $24 million in Somalia next year to repair oil storage and other facilities in the port of Berbera. It was built by the Soviet Union but nearly abandoned when the Somali Government had a falling-out with Moscow in 1977.\n\nAn additional $26 million would be spent in Kenya to dredge the port at Mombasa and to provide other fleet support there. American warships patrolling the Indian Ocean have called at Mombasa several times over the last year. Project on Diego Garcia\n\nCounting increases proposed by the Reagan Administration, the Pentagon plans to spend $237.7 million on the tiny island of Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean. It is owned by Britain but has been the site of United States naval and air bases for about 10 years.\n\nA primary project there, which has already been started, is lengthening the runways and building more aprons to accommodate B-52 bombers based on Guam. The Carter Administration began B-52 flights over the Indian Ocean last year but that has meant several aerial refuelings and exhausting trips for the crews.\n\nThe United States recently gained landing and refueling rights for the B-52's in northern Australia. When Diego Garcia is ready for them to land, their capabilities in the region will be greatly improved, according to military officers.\n\nIllustrations: map of Indian Ocean area",

        "instruction": "PEKING, Dec. 31— China publicly warned the United States today not to sell more arms to Taiwan. It called the issue a ''severe test'' of whether Washington valued its relations with Peking.\n\nIn a tough but carefully worded commentary, the People's Daily said the United States had ''failed to honor its commitment'' to respect China's sovereignty and had ''resorted to various prevarications'' in the three years since full diplomatic relations were established.\n\nThe newspaper speaks for the ruling Communist Party, and its commentary amounted to a statement by the Peking leadership. It did not elaborate on the accusations and did not mention the State Department's confirmation earlier this week that the United States intended to sell a multimillion dollar package of military spare parts to the Chinese Nationalists in Taiwan.\n\n''We must state explicitly,'' the commentary said, ''that, if the United States desires to preserve and develop its relations with China, it must seek, on the basis of genuine respect for China's sovereignty, a solution to the issue of selling arms to Taiwan. There is no other way.'' (The United States has not made public the size of the sale to Taiwan, but an American official in Washingto n said it would involve about $97 million in spare parts.)\n\nThe commentary comes at a time when the Chinese press has adopted a tougher line toward the United States, linking it with the Soviet Union as the superpowers and criticizing American actions like reconnaissance flights over North Korea. Chinese sources have confirmed that the tougher line in the press reflects dissatisfaction over the issue of arms sales to Taiwan.\n\nPeking has viewed such American proposals as selling updated versions of the F-5E jet fighter, which Taiwan already has, as a subterfuge for mollifying China's objections to the sale of new arms. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said two days ago that China was asking the United States to clarify its reported decision to sell spare parts.\n\nThe Chinese leadership has avoiding saying what it would do if arms sales went through anyway. Some officials have said that China would have no option but to retaliate, and one official said this could involve downgrading relations with the United States.\n\nWhen the Netherlands sold two submarines to Taiwan last summer, China reduced its relations to the level of a liaison office without a resident ambassador. Some diplomats have questioned whether China would go so far with the United States.\n\nSome diplomats detected in today's press commentary a note of conciliation in the suggestion that Peking and Washington might discuss differences over the issue of arms sales to Taiwan, which Peking considers part of China.\n\nThe People's Daily said that, once the United States recognized that it should stop interfering in China's internal affairs by selling arms to Taiwan, ''the two sides may negotiate ways and means of settling this issue.'' Encroachment on Sovereignty Seen\n\nOne proposal previously rumored to have been made by Peking is that the United States might agree to phase out its arms deliveries over a period of perhaps five years while reiterating its acceptance of the view that there is only one China and that Taiwan is an integral part. There is no indication whether such a formula has ever been discussed. The People' s Daily said China opposed the sale of arms to Taiwan byall countries , particularly those that had diplomatic relations with Peking.\n\n''Those who insist on selling arms to Taiwan encroach on China's sovereignty and interfere in its internal affairs,'' the commentary said. ''And the United States is no exception in this matter.''\n\nThe paper said a nine-point proposal for peaceful reunification with Taiwan, made in September, had ''created conditions most favorable for ending United States arms sales to Taiwan and United States involvement in internal affairs.''\n\nThe proposal offered to give the Chinese Nationalist leaders of Taiwan high positions on the mainland and to let Taiwan retain its own armed forces and economic system. The Nationalists rejected the proposal as a trick.\n\nThe commentary today reiterated promises to ''make every effort to resolve the Taiwan question by peaceful means.'' It said that the Chinese people were ''watching whether the United States Government chooses to settle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan properly.''\n\n''This is a severe test for the United States Government that will show whether it truly values its relations with China and whether it has the global strategic pattern in mind,'' the People's Daily said, alluding to what it sees as a need for concerted United States-Chinese policies against the Soviet Union around the world.",

        "output": "China publicly warned the United States today not to sell more arms to Taiwan. It called the issue a ''severe test'' of whether Washington valued its relations with Peking.   In a tough but carefully worded commentary, the People's Daily said the United States had ''failed to honor its commitment'' to respect China's sovereignty and had ''resorted to various prevarications'' in the three years since full diplomatic relations were established.   The newspaper speaks for the ruling Communist Party, and its commentary amounted to a statement by the Peking leadership. It did not elaborate on the accusations and did not mention the State Department's confirmation earlier this week that the United States intended to sell a multimillion dollar package of military spare parts to the Chinese Nationalists in Taiwan."

        "instruction": "IT is probably safe to assume that an ''A-B split'' means nothing to most people. But in the test, test and test again world of direct marketing, an A-B split is the key to discovering the pulling power of magazine ads.\n\nNow, Jean Kobey Cohen, a second-generation advertising professional who works for Ogilvy & Mather Direct, wants to take the concept a step further, to something she calls ''space sharing.''\n\nAn A-B split is the practice of buying a page in a magazine to discover which of two versions of an ad for the same product produces the most orders. The two ads are alternated through the entire press run so that each gets similar distribution. Publishers charge premiums of varying amounts for the split.\n\nThe splits are very important to direct marketers, who care little for such hazy advertising concepts as measuring attitudinal changes. These advertisers instead measure efficiency in terms of actual sales.\n\nThe concept can also be taken further. People magazine, with its more than 2.4 million circulation, offers an A-B-C split and an A-B-C-D split.\n\nPeople in the business, like Jean Cohen, know just how productive a particular ad in a particular magazine should be. When one does not produce as expected, they know that it is time to try another publication.\n\n''The best ad in the world isn't going to work in the wrong place, this we know,'' she said. ''And every time an ad is placed it has to produce orders.''\n\nTo insure the productivity of magazines, they must be given tests. This can become expensive, however, once the advertiser gets past certain specialty publications that are obviously appropriate because the product's competitors are advertised in them.\n\n''Our business is so tied into space costs that you might have to pull 10 more orders for every $100 increase in the ad cost,'' Miss Cohen said. ''We are very price sensitive.''\n\nThis is where Miss Cohen's ''space sharing'' idea comes into play. Under Miss Cohen's plan, three different advertisers might be accommodated on a single full page with each placing a one-third-page ad. Thus, a test that might have cost a single advertiser $21,000 is instead reduced to $7,000. The premium would also be divided among the three participants.\n\nWhat makes her think the idea is novel, she said, is the enthusiastic response the plan has received from the magazines she has approached.\n\nUp to now, she has filled any available pages with ads from her own clients. ''We're fortunate in having clients who want to reach the same audiences,'' she said. ''So we can go to a magazine that offers an A-B split and create our space-sharing ad.''\n\n''Now what I'd like magazines to do is offer it as a concept for the industry,'' she continued. ''It would be for the benefit of everybody.''\n\nUnder those circumstances, it would be up to the magazines themselves to find partners, she said.\n\n''There's a lot in it for magazines,'' Miss Cohen said. ''They'd get more advertising. And the advertisers would be able to have at least twice the test schedule they'd normally have.''\n\nMiss Cohen, 34 years old and the daughter of Bobbette Kobey Cohen, one-time copywriter at the old Gumbinner-North agency, had wanted to be in advertising for a long time. She tried it all, she says - writing for a little agency in Connecticut and account service at the New York office of Dentsu.\n\n''Then I got into media and it was love,'' she recalled. It is a love that has deepened in direct marketing, she says, because ''you see the results.''\n\nShe worked for Rapp & Collins and Compton Direct before joining the Ogilvy & Mather subsidiary.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Jean Kobey Cohen",

        "instruction": "Sometimes you just have to up your game.\n\nThis fall’s movie lineup shows actors stretching, directors reaching, funny men turning serious, and glamour gals going grim. Is something in the water out west? The long march to the last awards season was a showcase of collaborative professionalism (“Gravity,” “Captain Phillips,” “August: Osage County”) and thematic darkness (“12 Years a Slave,” “Nebraska,” “Her”). By contrast, the ambitions this year seem unusually . . . individual. These are people with stories to tell and — more than that — something to prove.\n\nHow else can you explain that the one sure thing of autumn, the marital thriller “Gone Girl,” is made by people who’ve already proved it: director David Fincher (“The Social Network”), star Ben Affleck (“Argo”), novelist-co-scripter Gillian Flynn. Elsewhere, pop-culture whiplash is to be expected as audiences take in “Foxcatcher,” featuring Steve Carell in a shape-shifting dramatic role as a psychotic millionaire, or “Birdman,” in which gonzo Mexican director Alejandro Iñárritu gets onetime Batman Michael Keaton to bite the role that made him a star.\n\nMia Wasikowska and Reese Witherspoon each hit the road in biographical sagas about women making solo treks through the wilderness: Wasikowska across 1,700 miles of Australian Outback in Robyn Davidson’s “Tracks” and Witherspoon up 1,000 miles of Pacific Coast Trail in “Wild,” based on Cheryl Strayed’s memoir.\n\nChristian Bale is playing no less than Moses in “Exodus: Gods and Kings” for director Ridley Scott. Lovable Bradley Cooper is playing the late “American Sniper” Chris Kyle for Clint Eastwood. Eddie Redmayne, the lovestruck revolutionary Marius in 2012’s “Les Miserables,” will be seen as the young, lovestruck Stephen Hawking in “The Theory of Everything.” Even Quvenzhané Wallis wants you to know there’s more to her than “Beasts of the Southern Wild” — there’s “Annie.”\n\nBoston’s longest-running film festivals open and close the fall season.\n\nA few years ago, Brad Pitt was joking his way through World War II in “Inglourious Basterds”; now he’s a deadly serious tank commander in David Ayer’s “Fury.” And that hardly compares to what Mrs. Pitt’s been up to: “Unbroken,” a grueling true-life tale of World War II survival, may bring Angelina Jolie into the circle of Academy Award directing nominees.\n\nNor is she the only director aiming higher than usual. Christopher Nolan (“Inception,” the “Dark Knight” trilogy) is no slouch, but “Interstellar” looks to be his bid to enter Kubrick territory, with Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain along for the ride. Paul Thomas Anderson (“The Master”) tackles previously unfilmable novelist Thomas Pynchon in “Inherent Vice.” Jon Stewart goes behind the camera for “Rosewater,” a not-at-all funny account of an imprisoned journalist in Iran. And if you’ve never heard of writer-directors Damien Chazelle or Justin Simien — well, after “Whiplash” and “Dear White People,” you will.\n\nEven the franchise installments seem more weighty and war-torn than usual, with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) joining the underground rebels in “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1” and all Smaug breaking loose in “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies.” But the ultimate sign of the fall movie season’s ambitions? With an all-singing cast that includes Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, Emily Blunt, and Anna Kendrick, Rob Marshall’s “Into the Woods” wants to take Stephen Sondheim to the nation’s multiplexes. Let’s hope that dream has a fairy-tale ending.\n\nTHE DROP Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, and the late James Gandolfini star in this adaptation of Dennis Lehane’s crime novel. A Brooklyn bartender (Hardy) finds that involvement with organized crime may not be such a good idea after all.\n\nDOLPHIN TALE 2 As in the original, cetacean patients get treatment in a Florida aquarium hospital. Returning for the sequel are Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nTHE GREEN PRINCE This documentary recounts the story of a young Palestinian, Mosab Hassan Yousef, who becomes a spy for the Israelis. The catch? His father was a founder of Hamas.\n\nTHE MAN ON HER MIND A romantic comedy where it isn’t just boy and girl who meet — so do dream and reality. Amy McAllister and Shane Attwooll star.\n\nA MASTER BUILDER Jonathan Demme directed this updated version of Ibsen’s classic drama. Wallace Shawn, who did the adaptation, stars, along with Julie Hagerty and Andre Gregory.\n\nNO GOOD DEED If you’re an affluent suburban housewife (Taraji P. Henson), should you offer assistance when an escaped convict shows up on your doorstep? The answer isn’t as obvious as it might seem, with Idris Elba playing the escapee.\n\nJEALOUSY In this French drama, a man’s decision to leave his wife and daughter has consequences both predictable and otherwise. Louis Garrel, Anna Mouglalis, and Rebecca Convenant star.\n\nLEVEL FIVE This one-of-a-kind film, from 1997, by the late Chris Marker, a one-of-a-kind filmmaker, finally gets a US release. Part documentary, part fiction, it braids together technology and history (specifically, the Battle of Okinawa) for a meditation on human agency and memory.\n\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE OF ELEANOR RIGBY A New York couple (James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain) confront personal tragedy in this third and concluding film of writer-director Ned Benson’s triptych about a marriage.\n\nLAST DAYS IN VIETNAM Rory Kennedy has directed this documentary about the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nTHE MAZE RUNNER In this adaptation of James Dashner’s best-selling YA novel, a group of adolescent boys whose memories have been erased live in a kind of orphanage.

Yes, he does. But he’s spry enough to star in this adaptation of the ’80s CBS series about a retired intelligence operative. Much of the film was shot in Boston and on the North Shore.\n\nTHE BOXTROLLS Lovable subterranean creatures raise a young human. A not-so-lovable old human does not approve.

By contrast, the ambitions this year seem unusually... individual. These are people with stories to tell and -- more than that -- something to prove."

        "instruction": "-- The Vicksburgh Citizen publishes the following order as having been issued by Gen. BUTLER in New Orleans:\n\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,\n\nAs the officers and soldiers of the United States have been subject to repeated insults from the women calling themselves \"ladies of New-Orleans,\" in return for the most scrupulous non-interference and courtesy on our part, it is ordered that hereafter, when any female shall by word, gesture or movement, insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States, she shall be regarded and held liable to be treated as a woman of the town plying her avocation.\n\nBy command of Major-Gen. BUTLER.\n\nIt is further stated that Gen. BEAUREGARD directed this order to be read at the head of every regiment of the Confederate army, together with an appeal, from himself, to the \"men of the South\" to avenge this \"outrage perpetrated \"upon their mothers, wives, daughters and sisters, by the ruffianly soldiers of the North.\"\n\nIf Gen. BUTLER has issued any such order, he should be forthwith dismissed from the army. It would be a disgrace to the service, -an infamous outrage upon the morality and decency of the country and the age. It purports to be a warning addressed to the ladies, but is really a license expressly given to the soldiers to treat as a \"woman of the town\" every female who may \"by word, gesture or movement, insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United Stales.\" Such insults may be very annoying and may deserve punishment, or at least measures of repression, though we believe that as yet they are not offences against any code of laws, either civil or military. But to commit their punishment to the unrestrained and sanctioned license of a rough soldiery, would be a stride toward the brutality of the most barbarous ages, from which we trust the Union cause will be protected. Such an order would inflict lasting disgrace on the officer who should issue it, and bring the cause he professed to serve into just and general contempt.\n\nThe whole thing is clearly a fabrication. The fact of its being used by BEAUREGARD to stimulate the decaying ardor of his troops, brands its character. This renegade General has proved himself already to be the most reckless and remorseless liar in the rebel service, -- and that is saying a good deal. The public will not soon forget the order he issued at the very outset, of the war, filled with kindred calumnies upon the Union troops, falsifying utterly and infamously the whole tenor of their conduct, and showing himself to be totally unscrupulous as to the truth or falsehood of anything to which he might attach his official signature. This pretended order of Gen. BUTLER's is evidently one of his forgeries. It is exactly in his line. It embodies precisely the means for prosecuting the war which have been his favorites from the beginning. He has always sought to stimulate the hatred of his troops by telling them the most enormous falsehoods about the conduct of Northern soldiers towards the women of the South. This is a device of precisely that kind. It comes from the same mint, is used by the same man, aims at the same result, and will be found to be \"off the same piece\" as the other falsehoods to which Gen. BEAUREGARD's official signature has been affixed.\n\nIf vigorous, steady and courageous lying is a high military qualifications in the rebel army, BEAUREGARD has certainly won by actual service the distinction he has acquired. FLOYD may be a greater thief, WISE may be a bigger braggart, and MAGRUDER may drink more whisky; but in solid, substantial and serviceable lying, BEAUREGARD is clearly the ablest and most indefatigable General in the rebel camp.",

He was 82 years old and lived in Schenectady.\n\nHe died of heart disease, his wife, Jane, said.\n\nThe four-day siege in the upstate maximum-security prison erupted on Sept. 9, 1971, when more than 1,000 inmates seized 43 hostages. During the revolt and siege, a guard and three inmates were killed. Mr. Oswald tried in vain to negotiate a settlement. Ultimatums of surrender and amnesty were rejected and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller refused to go to the prison at the behest of a committee of civilian observers seeking a nonviolent solution.\n\nOn Sept. 13, on orders from Commissioner Oswald and with the Governor's approval, more than 1,000 heavily armed officers stormed the prison amid a torrent of gunfire and tear gas. In the battle -- the bloodiest in American prison history -- 29 inmates and 10 prison employees were killed. Tarnished Relations\n\nThe tragedy generated a rash of investigations, lawsuits and indictments, a few trials, some prison reforms and lingering questions.\n\nA yearlong state inquiry into Attica sharply criticized Mr. Rockefeller for not going to the prison during the uprising.\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the rebellion began spontaneously, while Mr. Oswald later asserted that it was a planned revolutionary act. He defended his actions in a book, \"Attica -- My Story,\" which was published by Doubleday in 1972.\n\nThe uprising tarnished relations between the Governor and the Commissioner. In April 1973, Mr. Oswald resigned after holding his post for less than two and a half years, and Mr. Rockefeller appointed him to the state's newly expanded Crime Victims Compensation Board. He retired from that post in 1978.\n\nRussell George Oswald was born in Racine, Wis., on Aug. 4, 1908. He won 10 letters in high school sports and worked his way through college.\n\nHe studied at the University of Wisconsin and at Marquette University, where he earned a law degree. He also earned a master's degree in psychiatric social work at Loyola University. In World War II, he held a Navy commission, commanding gun crews on cargo ships. 'No Case Is Hopeless'\n\nEarly on, Mr. Oswald held posts as director of county public assistance agencies in the Milwaukee area, Police Commissioner in Racine, director of the Wisconsin Bureau of Probation and Parole and then director of the State Division of Corrections.\n\nIn 1955, Mr. Oswald became Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Correction, where he made clear that he believed that too many prisoners were in maximum-security units around the country. His philosophy was that \"no case is hopeless\" and that emphasis should be placed on rehabilitation.\n\nHe earned wide praise for humanitarianism and expertise in criminal rehabilitation and Governor Rockefeller appointed him to the New York State Board of Parole in 1957 and as the state's Commissioner of Correctional Services in December 1970.\n\nIn the heat of the Attica uprising, a colleague said of Mr. Oswald, \"He is a man who is extremely interested in human beings.\"\n\nSurvivors, besides his wife, include a son, Kurt, of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and three grandchildren.\n\nPhoto: Russell G.

        "instruction": "MOSCOW, March 29— The Soviet Union pressed its attack against the Polish trade union organization Solidarity today, accusing it of trying to intimidate Polish security forces and wrest control from the Government.\n\nThe new charges, made in a report by the official Soviet press agency Tass, reinforced the impression among Western diplomats in Moscow that the Soviet Union was seeking to discourage major concessions to Solidarity in negotiations in Warsaw.\n\nTass said that Solidarity, in preparation for a general strike Tuesday, was engaging in activities that had no place in a Communist country.\n\n''The local organizations of Solidarity are doing their utmost to discredit the police and security organs and to intimidate their employees,'' Tass said. Tass Tells of 'Subversive' Acts\n\nThe press agency said that ''subversive'' and ''extremist'' elements were drawing up lists of police and security officials to be ''isolated'' during the strike, setting up roadblocks and even trying to seize post offices.\n\nTass said ''antisocialist forces'' even managed to seize a television transmitting facility in Warsaw and that they had ''captured'' food stores in another city. In Wroclaw, it said, Solidarity leaders ''launched brazen attacks'' on the Communist Party.\n\nThroughout the country, Tass said, ''provocative'' instructions are being issued for seizing factories and mobilizing public and private transport for the duration of the strike.\n\nTass said that the nature of the instructions ''put out illegally by Solidarity's leaders shows that this organization is resorting to open methods of struggle against the lawful state authorities.'' Dissidents Also Are Criticized\n\nTass also charged that the Self-Defense Committee, the Polish dissident group known by its initials, KOR, and which is allied with Solidarity, had so strengthened its position within the trade union that it was ''actually running Solidarity.''\n\nThe Tass report was in contrast to the guarded hopes for a negotiated settlement expressed by Government and Solidarity leaders at the close of a round of talks yesterday.\n\n''It is hard to read this report, coming at this delicate time, as anything but discouragement of the idea of any basic compromise,'' a Western diplomat said. ''What it implies is that the time for concessions is past and the time to reassert full control is here.''\n\nThe diplomat and many of his colleagues said that the harshness of the Soviet comments, including accusations that Solidarity was putting forward ''antisocialist demands,'' were probably designed to strengthen the hard-liners in the Polish party who favor an unyielding posture, if not a crackdown. An Objection to U.S. Warning\n\nIn a separate comment, Tass objected to President Reagan's warning Friday that military intervention in Poland would have a serious effect on East-West relations.\n\n''The United States Administration should not 'warn' other countries,'' Tass said, ''but should stop its own interference in whatever form in the internal affairs of the Polish People's Republic, which has been, is and will be a socialist state.''",

        "instruction": "By ADAM RUBIN DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER\n\nSaturday, January 13th 2001, 2:15AM\n\nVic Wallace was between meetings at the American Football Coaches Association convention on Sunday afternoon when he walked into the lobby of the Hyatt Regency Atlanta. There, on a large-screen television, Wallace caught a glimpse of Ron Dixon's 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, which set the tone for the Giants' playoff victory against the Eagles.\n\n\"He did a great job on the run,\" said Wallace, who coached Dixon at Lambuth College in Jackson, Tenn., last season. \"When I saw the end-zone view and all the cuts he had to make, it was even more impressive.\"\n\nIt may seem that Dixon came to the Giants from nowhere, but the rookie's ascent to a third-round draft choice and playoff hero actually took him virtually everywhere. Bad behavior and bad grades forced Dixon on a winding path, from Itawamba (Miss.) Community College, to Division II West Georgia, to Lake Sumpter and Tallahassee community colleges in Florida, to NAIA Lambuth, and mixed in there was a job digging trenches.\n\n\"By the time he got here, he realized it was his last chance,\" said Lambuth teammate Chris Edwards. \"When I met him, he had his head screwed on straight.\"\n\nSaid Dixon: \"I had to make something happen in the classroom and on the field.\"\n\nEdwards spent last Sunday afternoon at Lambuth's Harris Hall, where students throughout the dorm watched the Giants-Eagles game. It's not often Lambuth players are in the national spotlight. The school's other recent NFL product, Robert Reed, had one catch for the San Diego Chargers during the 1999 season and was recently released by the XFL's Memphis Maniax.\n\nSo, on Sunday, it wasn't long before shouts rang out at Harris Hall, which housed Dixon last year, in response to his kickoff return.\n\n\"When he came here, he had that one goal in his mind,\" Edwards said. \"He talked about just getting a chance, catching the eye of one team and everyone would be interested.\"\n\nHow intent was Dixon on an NFL career? Edwards recalled that after one Lambuth game, teammates went to a local club. Dixon stayed behind.\n\n\"He was out at 3 in the morning running sprints,\" Edwards said. \"He was looking forward to the next game.\"\n\nSaid Dixon: \"I did my partying, and that put me in the situation that I was in, so I felt the need to tie up all the loose ends. While they were going out, I was looking at the big picture.\"\n\nDixon's new-found commitment came after a number of opportunities at other schools slipped through his hands.\n\nDixon committed to the University of Central Florida while a senior at Wildwood (Fla.) High, where he would have played with Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who enrolled a year later, in 1995. But Dixon lacked the necessary ACT score.\n\nInstead, he enrolled at Itawamba (Miss.) Community College, where he played quarterback in an option attack that included Philadelphia's Duce Staley. After completing two years there, Dixon joined Division II West Georgia as a wide receiver. However, academics ended his West Georgia career after one season.\n\n\"I did just enough to get by,\" Dixon said of his college experience. \"After like three years, that's not good enough. You can't just skate through. I skated through with Cs an Ds. Sometimes I wouldn't even go to class and I'd get a C. But after like three years or so, you have to hit it. And I still wasn't.\"\n\nDixon spent the next year at community colleges near his Florida home trying to become eligible.\n\nPaul Jones, a scout for the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos and an acquaintance of Wallace, told the Lambuth coaching staff about Dixon.\n\n\"After West Georgia, (Jones) had me try out for the Canadian League,\" Dixon said. \"But my knee was kind of banged up. ... So just out of the blue one day he called my mom and my dad and asked did I want to go back to school. And that was the hook-up at Lambuth.\"\n\nHowever, it wasn't that simple. Despite good grades, Dixon was one credit short of being eligible at Lambuth and had to sit out a second straight football season, according to Wallace. Dixon dug trenches for a sprinkler installation service in Jackson, Tenn., until he got on scholarship in the spring, although that didn't last too long.\n\n\"I think I did that job like three days,\" Dixon said. \"I was like, 'Oh, no. Digging ditches, that's not my style.'\"\n\nFinally, in 1999, he returned to football.\n\nDuring his only season at Lambuth, Dixon set several school records: receptions in a season (89), average yards per catch (19.5), punt return average (27.9 yards), longest punt return for a TD (95 yards) and longest kickoff return for a TD (92 yards).\n\nWatching the Giants game Sunday, Dixon's Lambuth teammates were reminded of an Oct. 23, 1999, kickoff return for a TD against Georgetown (Ky.) College.\n\nDixon pointed to the end zone just before the kickoff, as he had done at Lambuth.\n\n\"They were on the sideline and I was reading Ron's lips, 'I'm going to take it to the house. I'm going to take it to the house.' When he hit the seam, I knew he had the speed to take it,\" Edwards said. \"Against Georgetown he did the same thing. He ran the exact same kickoff. I told him he needs to point every time he gets back there.\"\n\n\"It was kind of deja vu,\" Lambuth quarterback Rashad Smith said. \"He was pointing just like he was pointing in college. He came out before every game and would point like that, and he always made the key plays.\"\n\nThe Giants saw the potential when they used a third-round pick on Dixon. But there have been trying times during Dixon's rookie season.\n\nLast month, after missing a Saturday morning team meeting and then being suspended for the Pittsburgh game, Giants coach Jim Fassel pledged to make Dixon a \"personal project of mine.\"\n\nIn September, Dixon and Ike Hilliard were no-shows for a Saturday walk-through practice. Dixon said they were playing Sony PlayStation late the night before and he forgot to set the alarm. He's received wake-up calls from his parents since.\n\n\"I've been playing this game for so long, it's always just been a game,\" Dixon said. \"I had to realize that this is much more than a game now, it's a job. I was a little irresponsible. But I don't think about the past, I just learn from it.\"\n\nWallace said there was no similar problem at Lambuth.\n\n\"By this time he had sort of taken an inventory of his goals and aspirations and knew that Lambuth was giving him a chance,\" Wallace said. \"And he did not let us down in the classroom, nor did he let us down in community, nor did he let us down on the field.\"\n\nSaid Dixon: \"When I want to do something, I'll do it. ... I came out with like a 3.0 (GPA). That was something that had to be done to reach this point.\"\n\nNow, far more people are recognizing Dixon and his accomplishments. Dixon said he was spotted walking down the street outside of a grocery store as a result of the publicity from his kickoff return.\n\n\"A guy asked me was if I was Dixon,\" Dixon said. \"I was like, 'No, that's my cousin.'\"\n\nDixon said he always felt he would succeed in the NFL, despite attending five colleges and missing the 1997 and '98 seasons.\n\n\"I was always confident in my ability,\" Dixon said. \"And I always knew, somehow, some way, something was going to happen. I missed out on a lot of that by not doing what I needed to do in the classroom in high school. And then by going to junior college, I missed out on it again. I was able to still make it.\"",

The festival celebrated its 60th by expanding from two days to three, with Friday devoted to “emerging artists.”\n\nAside from Zorn, these artists covered a wide range of styles. Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society extended the big band tradition with overlapping rhythmic grooves, textural variety, and dynamic range. Argue also made a couple of the day’s more political comments, dedicating one tune to the military contractor Blackwater International and another to the pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, who was persecuted for being gay. Rudresh Mahanthappa’s quintet deconstructed the music of Charlie Parker. Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks dug into the details of ’20s-era jazz. New Orleans musician Jon Batiste led a second-line parade in front of the mainstage.\n\nGiven the biggest chunk of time, Zorn took Fort Adams’s interior Quad Stage for one of his Masada Marathons, covering the many kinds of ensembles he writes for under that moniker. Was it “sick”? Not exactly. Zorn’s various Masada projects have a strong streak of the minor-keyed melodies and odd meters of Jewish klezmer music. His longstanding Masada Quartet split the difference between klezmer and Ornette Coleman, with its folky, loose-unison themes and passages of free blowing. Sometimes the klezmer-like melodies took on a Latin or Arabic tinge.\n\nThe violinist Mark Feldman and pianist Sylvie Courvoursier played a virtuoso set that veered into tango. With the quintet Bar Kokhba, guitarist Marc Ribot took off into a bluesy frenzy that conjured the Latin rock of Santana. That final number, from Electric Masada, sent up squalls of jammy jazz-rock abetted by laptop noise.\n\nZorn alternately played, directed the bands from a seat onstage, or sat in the wings, smiling approvingly. And he brought all nine bands in ahead of schedule. This former enfant terrible appears to have superior organizational skills.",

        "instruction": "Back in April, there were lots of reports about how private equity investor Tom Gores was planning to buy the Detroit Pistons basketball franchise and related assets. I put a slightly different spin on it, saying that the majority owner would be a private equity fund managed by Gores’ firm Platinum Equity, rather than Gores himself.\n\nIn response, some Detroit sports scribes basically said I didn’t know what I was talking about. Here was Vince Ellis of the Detroit Free Press:\n\nA published blog posted on fortune.com Wednesday may have been misleading in speculating that this will be the first time a private equity fund will be the primary owner of an NBA franchise. Here are the facts: The deal’s structure does include a minority investment from one of Platinum’s private equity funds — along with financing from Comerica — but Gores is putting up the majority of the capital and will be the owner. This is not an unusual arrangement. The Pistons’ current ownership team has minority investors, and so does nearly every other team in the league. The NBA insists on a single owner who controls the team, and that will be Gores.\n\nTurns out we were both right. Sort of.\n\nPlatinum Equity does indeed own 51% of Palace Sports & Entertainment (the holding company), meaning that a private equity fund is technically the majority owner. But Gores is a significant investor in Platinum funds, which means he indirectly owns a majority stake. Moreover, Gores is the top decision-maker at Platinum – giving him sole operational control.\n\nIt will be interesting to eventually learn more about how the deal is structured, including what happens if it goes bad. Remember, an individual owner can hold onto a money-losing franchise, so long as they can stomach the hit. A fund with outside investors, however, has different fiduciary obligations.",

        "instruction": "LJUBLJANA, Slovenia, March 23— Slovenes voted overwhelmingly today to join the European Union and gave strong support to membership in NATO in twin referendums.\n\nAs results were announced, political leaders gathered to celebrate in Preseren Square in the center of the capital, where a small crowd of about 400 people had gathered. Dmitrij Rupel, whose political career began as a dissident and a campaigner for Slovene independence when Slovenia was still part of Yugoslavia, said the vote was a watershed in the history of this small country of 1.9 million, which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.\n\n''The transition is over,'' Mr. Rupel said as he shook hands with Janez Jansa, another veteran of the fight for independence, and now leader of the opposition Social Democrats, who had backed the government's call for a yes on both ballots.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Rupel told reporters Slovenia had passed a ''very tough test'' of its democratic maturity and would now have to meet the difficult tasks of adapting its economic, military and social systems to European standards.\n\n''You are back in Europe where you belong,'' said the president of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, who joined Slovene leaders at a victory banquet in a fashionable restaurant.\n\nIn preliminary results based on 99 percent of the ballots, 89.6 percent supported their country's entry into the European Union and 66 percent supported membership in NATO.\n\nIn Brussels, NATO's secretary general, Lord Robertson, saluted the Slovenes' ''willingness to accept the obligations of membership.''\n\nPolls and interviews during the campaign indicated that many Slovenes felt that their country had little to gain from joining NATO. Antiwar protests last week often carried a strong anti-NATO message, and 79.5 percent of those asked in a poll published Saturday in the daily Dnevnik said they opposed the war in Iraq.\n\nSlovenia is the only one of seven countries invited to join NATO last November that is holding a referendum on membership. On Wednesday, the leaders of all seven -- the others are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania -- are scheduled to sign accession protocols in Brussels.\n\nOf the 10 expected candidates for European Union membership, Slovenia was the second nation to hold a referendum -- Malta was the first -- and the margin of the yes vote is expected to encourage support for the organization in other countries, particularly the Baltic states. All 10 candidates are scheduled to join in May 2004.\n\nDespite the strong support for NATO from both the government and the political opposition, Slovenia's government has avoided taking a direct stand on backing the United States in the war on Iraq.\n\n''Aaaach, I voted for NATO and the European Union,'' said Milan Cadez, a 59-year old economist, as he left a polling place in downtown Ljubljana. ''Now it is not a choice. Only America is capable of doing anything for peace. The E.U. is not capable of doing anything. They watched the crimes in Bosnia and when the Americans come, they make order.''\n\nAli Zerdin, deputy editor of the weekly newsmagazine Mladina, said the government's last-minute campaign to distinguish between NATO itself and the United States' unpopular war on Iraq was clearly successful.\n\n''The government's pre-referendum campaign was focused on making a distinction between NATO and the Iraqi issue,'' he said. ''The government's campaign here was successful. But I am not sure the campaign was truthful.''\n\nMr. Zerdin said it was ''quite a significant achievement'' for the anti-NATO campaigners -- many of them intellectuals -- to get a third of the votes, particularly when all the political parties and the influential Roman Catholic church had called for a yes vote.\n\nSlovenia's vocal opponents of NATO entry warned that the government must heed the solid third of the vote against NATO. ''Every single vote against NATO is a an exceptional vote of no confidence in the ruling elite,'' said Vlasta Jalusic, director of the Peace Institute, a nongovernmental organization.\n\nLuka Juri, a leading anti-NATO campaigner, echoed the fear of many Slovenes that Slovenia will become simply a pawn of larger NATO members and be forced to take sides in conflicts it wants no part of.\n\nAs part of Yugoslavia, Slovenia was outside both the Warsaw Pact and NATO, sitting on the sidelines of the cold war and going its own way. ''Slovenia developed democracy on its own,'' said Katja Skoberne, a prominent television talk show host. ''I don't see NATO helping it.''",

        "instruction": "The shortage of priests in the Roman Catholic Church, a growing problem worldwide for a decade, will soon reach crisis proportions in the United States, researchers say. Their figures indicate that the Catholic Church in this country will have 50 percent fewer active clergymen by the end of the century than it has today.\n\nSeminary enrollment continues to decline, despite recruiting efforts. In 1966 there were 48,000 seminarians, and in 1972, there were 22,963. Now there are 11,500, according to statistics that The Official Catholic Directory is to officially release tomorrow. This number is down 800 from last year and not all those now enrolled will finish their three years or more of seminary studies and be approved for ordination.\n\nAccording to the directory, there are now 58,085 religious and diocesan priests in the United States, 315 fewer than last year. Researchers at the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago predict there will be fewer than 25,000 priests in the United States by the end of this century.\n\nMany Catholic bishops look to expanded ''lay ministries'' to take up some of the slack. But the search for a larger answer discloses no sign that the church is willing to reshape the ordained ministry in ways to produce more priests. Such changes would almost certainly involve revision of the policy of mandatory celibacy and a reconsideration of the question of women priests. The Vatican has consistently opposed change in these areas, and bishops favoring change would be pitting themselves against the Pope.\n\nThe loss of priests comes when the Catholic population of the United States is increasing. The publisher of The Official Catholic Directory, P.J. Kenedy & Sons of New York, reports that this year there are 51,207,579 Catholics in the United States, up 57,737 from last year. Last year's total of 982,586 infant baptisms was up 38,954 from the previous year and there were 92,861 adult conversions to Catholicism, according to the publishers.\n\nAlthough some dioceses report slight increases in ordinations this year, there are clearly not enough new priests to replace those who resign, retire or die.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Chicago, the nation's largest, with more than 2.5 million Catholics in 444 parishes, will ordain only seven new priests this year, the smallest class in its history. The archdiocese now has 2,500 priests, and does not know how many of these will retire this year.\n\nThe diocese of Brooklyn, with 1,300 priests in 221 parishes and 13 of these retiring, will ordain three. Detroit, which has fewer than 500 active priests and nearly 400 parishes, may ordain 10 men this year. The Detroit Archdiocese does not know how many of its priests will be retiring. No Sign of Increase Seen\n\n''There are no signs of any increase in vocations to the priesthood,'' William McCready of the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago said, using earlier studies as a basis for his conclusion. The center, which describes itself as a social science research organization, has studied topics of interest to the Catholic Church. Branches of the church sometimes commission studies by the center.\n\nFurthermore, if current trends persist, about half those ordained this year might be expected to resign from the priesthood in 20 years. Rejection of the policy of celibacy has been the chief cause of resignations, according to research by the Chicago organization.\n\nAs a result of all these factors, the average age of the active priest is going up and retirements in the 1980's and 1990's will claim a greater percentage of the active priests than might otherwise be expected. Present church policy suggests that priests retire by 75, and most do so.\n\nRecent research by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops also forecasts a financial strain because the church will have to care for larger numbers of retired priests. Other Problems Created\n\nThe decline in the number of priests creates a complex of problems. According to Catholic theology, a priest must preside at the celebration of the eucharist, the chief rite of Christian worship. As head of his parish, he is the symbol of the church's authority.\n\nThe church is now allowing nonordained people to do certain types of parish work. Under this ''lay ministry,'' men and women help distribute holy communion at mass and to shut-ins. A nun may be an ''assistant pastor'' and take the main responsibility for preparing children for confirmation.\n\nBut the number of nuns is also declining. There are now 120,000 nuns in the United States, down from 180,000 in 1968. Married deacons work at secular jobs, but are ordained to witness marriages, baptize and do other pastoral work. Auxiliary Bishop Anthony F. Mestice of New York is one of those who believes increased lay involvement in the church is a sign of hope. ''It means that Catholics are responding to the needs of their parishes,'' said Bishop Mestice, chairman of the United States Catholic Bishops' committee on vocations. He also believes this involvement will lead to more vocations to the priesthood. Church Requires a Priest",

        "instruction": "President Obama’s team of campaign strategists said today they expect a drawn out Republican primary that will play to Obama’s advantage, ceding more time to craft a general election narrative largely unchallenged while ultimately producing a weakened GOP challenger in 2012.\n\n“This is an unusual year, the most unpredictable Republican race I’ve seen in my lifetime,” Obama’s chief campaign strategist David Axelrod told reporters at a briefing in Washington.\n\n“Whether it’s [Mitt] Romney or [Newt] Gingrich, or if someone else were to surprise us, the debate is going to be largely the same because the economic theory on their side is largely the same,” he said. “The longer this race goes, the more you’re going to see these Republican candidates mortgage their general election campaigns to try and win the nomination.”\n\nThe Obama team believes the duel between Gingrich and Romney, which could play out through next June, will force both potential Obama challengers to shift far more to the right than any of the Democratic candidates had to move during their lengthy primary campaign four years ago.\n\n“There’s this kind of reign of terror going on in the Republican Party where you’re not allowed to step out of line, where you have to genuflect at the altar of Grover Norquist and Rush [Limbaugh] and the others,” Axelrod said, indicating the “extreme” positions will hurt the party next fall.\n\nThe Democrats predict the former House speaker will dominate the Iowa caucuses and primaries in South Carolina and Florida, where he’s leading in the polls, while Romney will surge in February in the primary states he carried in 2008. They also see Gingrich doing well in the mostly southern “Super Tuesday” states in March, forcing a continuing battle for delegates into May or June.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama’s campaign is expected to deploy “major field operations” in all the key battleground states early next year and prepare for aggressive, direct engagement with voters as soon as there’s a clear GOP nominee, aides said. Campaign manager Jim Messina said Obama’s grassroots organizing is already unmatched by any of the Republican candidates.\n\nObama volunteers have held more than 1 million conversations with potential voters, at least 90,000 one-on-one meetings about the campaign, and enlisted more than 1,000 young organizers to hit the road this fall.\n\n“I think we have more staffers on the ground in Iowa than any of the other campaigns right now,” Messina said. “We have infrastructure on the ground in all the key states. I don’t think any of them [Republicans] do. And in the general election, that’s going to be an advantage for us in turning people out.”\n\nAs for the president’s message, Axelrod said Obama will hue closely to the themes laid out in his speech in Osawatomie, Kan., last week.\n\nWhile Obama will stress a “pivotal moment in our economy” and his plan for “not just recovery but economic security,” the campaign will underscore contrasts with the Republican vision, which Axelrod called “social Darwinism, trickle-down economics,” that they say led to the recession.\n\nWhen Mitt Romney says, “‘I understand the real economy,’ I think the American people understand that economy as well. And that aspect of the economy is one that they don’t appreciate and they don’t want to become the model for the future,” Axelrod said. “When he says, ‘I can fix the economy,’ their question is going to be for who? Who are you fixing the economy for?”\n\nThe president’s campaign team said the extended primary battle could also soften the blow from pro-Republican “super PACs” that might deplete some of their war chests during the in-fighting, before the general election.\n\n“We’re not going to be able to combat it dollar for dollar,” Axelrod said. “We’re going to combat it person to person, door to door. And a lot of it [money] may be deployed before they get to us.”",

(AP) — A pair of brothers and two other men have been charged with stealing nearly 1,200 laptops bound for public school students in New Jersey after investigators determined their story about a theft didn't add up.\n\nAnton Saljanin, 43, and Gjon Saljanin, 40, were due to appear in court Thursday with Ujka Vulaj, 54, and Carlos Caceres, 37, on charges including conspiracy and theft from an interstate shipment.\n\nIn January 2014, the Saljanins drove a truck from New York's Yorktown Heights to Massachusetts to pick up a shipment of 1,195 Apple MacBook Air laptops worth more than $1 million that were meant for two public high schools in New Jersey, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe next day, Anton Saljanin reported to Yorktown police that the truck had been stolen.

        "instruction": "The No. 1 task for the United States in Asia in 1982 is to repair our strained relations with China. Last year was not a good year for those relations; despite impressive efforts by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., the seeds have been sown for a full-scale crisis in 1982.\n\nSuch a crisis can and must be avoided. It would benefit only Moscow, and could well set back the huge strategic gains the relationship has provided both countries in the last 10 years.\n\nWe face a classic example of how domestic politics in two countries can interact to mutual disadvantage. Washington has deferred clarifying its policy on Taiwan for a year, while China has steadily stiffened its own position,\n\nIt is widely assumed that the only issue that matters is whether or not the Administration sells Taiwan an advanced fighter aircraft - the so-called FX or F5-G. Peking has threatened serious but unspecified consequences if Washington makes such a sale.\n\nOne view still holds that, because of their fear of the Russians, China will accept any American conduct toward Taiwan. The Chinese, however, have repeatedly and flatly rejected this thesis as a challenge to their soverignty. It would be foolish to gamble a decade's strategic gains and sell Taiwan a plane that, according to every United States Government study, it does not need - in the hope that Peking is bluffing.\n\nBut the problem now goes beyond the advanced aircraft. During a year of drift and delay over Taiwan by the Administration, China has hardened its attitude significantly - now obj ecting to any arms salesto Taiwan.\n\nOn the surface, the Chinese have not changed their official position. When we negotiated normalization in 1978, we made it clear to Peking that we could not proceed unless we continued to sell Taiwan ''carefully selected defensive weapons.'' Those were President Jimmy Carter's exact words. China made it equally clear that it could not agree to such sales. Having declared their position, the Chinese then proceeded with normalization.\n\nTrue to its word, the United States provide d Taiwan with arms in 1979 and 1980 at levels that we felt were justifiable for defensive purposes. The amount was substantial - more than $1 billion.\n\nChina protested each sale, but on a broad front the relationship moved forward dramatically, with enormous benefits to both nations. Trade boomed, about 30 major agreements were signed, mutual understanding increased, and the strategic relationship so important to global stability grew steadily. But the domestic political processes of the two countries, following their own internal imperatives, began to create problems:\n\n* As a result of campaign rhetoric in 1980, no amount of clarification by Washington could change Peking's view that the winning candidate had a personal preference for Taiwan.\n\n* A series of offhand comments and relatively minor decisions favoring by Taiwan by the Administration were overblown by an increasingly sensitive Peking. China suspected that Washington was trying to slip back toward a ''two-China'' policy.\n\n* Bureaucrats delayed export licenses for certain computers promised by high-level officials.\n\n* There was an initial lack of public comment by Washington on China's nine-point proposal to open talks with Taiwan. These should all have been treated as minor matters, speedily resolved; indeed, at Mr. Haig's urging the computers have been approved and the nine points publicly praised. But the cumulative effect left question marks about the relationship, and the mutual interaction of two domestic political processes has reduced the room for maneuver by both countries. Washington and Peking must now proceed to resolve their differences without further entrapping themselves.\n\nIf Peking insists on a precise timetable for the cessation of arms sales to Taiwan - something to which no President could agree at this time -we could face the most serious setback to our mutual interests in the last decade. If Washington miscalculates and tries to call Peking's bluff, the same unfortunate result could occur.\n\nThe almost unbelievable change in Sino-American relations in the last decade has been our nation's greatest bipartisan achievement, one in which three Presidents, two of them Republicans, share. This has been accomplished with no damage to the stability, security, or prosperity of Taiwan's 19 million people, who remain our eighth largest trading partner.\n\nIt is self-evident that both sides have everything to lose and nothing to gain by letting this issue wreck the relationship. Yet today we are perilously close to disaster. Only skill and patience and above all restraint on both sides will prevent an unnecessary setback to our mutual interests. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Holbrooke, who was Asssistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 1977 to 1981, is vice president of Public Strategies, a Washington-based consulting firm.",

I say that in this world behind every great effort is a black woman going unrecognized.''\n\nCertainly that was not the case this weekend for the Coalition of 100 Black Women which, with the addition of 14 states and the District of Columbia, was marking its transition from a local to a national association, nor for Mrs. McCabe, who was elected national president. The president of the New York Coalition since 1977, Mrs. McCabe is director of government/ community affairs for WNET/Channel 13. Several hundred dignitaries, including many influential members of the public and private sectors, turned out for a party given by the coalition at the Hilton Hotel Friday evening. They included Mayor Koch; City Council President Carol Bellamy; Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan; former Manhattan Borough President Percy E. Sutton; New York Secretary of State Basil A. Patterson, and James D. Robinson 3d, chairman and chief executive of the American Express Company. Mr. Robinson, along with officers of Philip Morris Inc. and other individuals, received awards for financial and moral support of the coalition.\n\nThe organization had its genesis in a small band of women meeting in one another's homes 11 years ago to address a multitude of troublesome issues. They chose their name because they hoped one day to have 100 members. The tributes to the group, which now has 825 members in New York, were voluminous and enthusiastic.\n\nAs David Dinkins, New York City Clerk and a candidate for Manhattan Borough President, put it: ''Influence is power, and they clearly have it. Individually these women are influential in government and business positions, so they are persuasive in the larger sphere.''\n\nAnd now that their boundaries extend to California, Representative Rangel said, ''There is no question that this organization will have a national voice. They have become a collective force of women who did not know each other in the past.''\n\nBesides throwing a jubilant party and holding a luncheon serious with talk of the goals of black women, the more than 40 women - lawyers, judges, educators, legislators, heads of corporations, social psychologists and community activists - from a variety of geographical areas rewrote and ratified a constitution, composed a resolution stating their mission and elected officers and a board.\n\nEmphasizing that the women fully recognized the achievements of other black organizations, Mrs. McCabe explained the need for the national coalition. ''Our biggest problem is that we have no forum; no one speaks specifically on our behalf. The women's movement defines itself by its achievers; why are we defined as domestic workers?''\n\nIn fact, when the representatives from each of the states joining the coalition were asked at a discussion to describe the most pressing problems for women in their states, they cited unemployment, Federal budget cuts, lack of housing, transportation and child care, along with persistent racism. But threaded through the problems specific to particular regions was a sense that black women lacked an effective vehicle of communication with one another.\n\nJatrice Gator, a lawyer and planning associate with the Community Service Council of Metropolitan Indianapolis, said, ''Before black women can begin to address issues, they must overcome complacency, lack of organizational skills and conceptualize what things can be done. Legislation for battered women was written in our state by a black women, but then there was no support expressed for it by black women. We must become aware that we can speak out.''\n\nEtrula R. Trotter, partner in a Memphis law firm, said, ''There is simply a lack of unity. The only unity that exists in Tennessee is that of ignorant, apathetic, rural white males.''\n\nEdith B. King, supervisor of employee development and training for the Gulf Oil Corporation, said, ''In Texas black women are auxiliarized to the extent that they are totally ineffective. Forums are need to strengthen them, to help them break out. We could have power, but we have no forum to help us move into power.''\n\nHer colleague, Judge Gabrielle K. McDonald of the United States District Court of Southern Texas, who said she was the second black judge of either sex to be appointed to a Federal seat in the South, elaborated: ''In Houston, there's a vacuum of women involved in anything but auxiliaries.''\n\n''The feminist movement hasn't hit black women in Texas,'' in part, she speculated, ''because there is still the black-white problem, that keeps women intent on helping their men. They don't realize that you can both act. It's dumb to say that adult women should have role models but that's exactly what we need.''\n\nDelia Young, who heads her own public relations firm in Kansas City, Mo., said, ''At last we will be structured for action. Until now we've had nothing. It's fine to have prophets; we have an abundance of those, but we need architects, too.''\n\nIn the view of Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a former United States Representative from California, who is now a partner in a law firm and was elected to the coalition's national board, the architects must turn their attention to economic advancement. ''We are seeing black women move into political power,'' she said, ''but they're missing in the corporate world. With all the outstanding black women, we simply don't have them in high places in private industry.''\n\nIn fact, she continued, ''Economic power has become even more elusive than it was 20 years ago for all blacks. For example, when white insurance companies wouldn't insure blacks, they formed their own companies, but when the white companies did, the black ones lost strength. Meanwhile the white companies haven't brought us in with any impact.''\n\nThe possibility that budget cutbacks and Federal policies easing antidiscriminatory regulations would indisputably affect the black community was so taken for granted that it was rarely discussed at the meeting. But Mrs. Burke did attack the Reagan Administration strongly in her luncheon address Saturday.\n\nStill the event ended in an optimistic mood that may be typical of the beginning of a mission in which strangers become allies. Evelyn Cunningham, who was director of the women's unit in the office of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and is now senior editor of Elan, a monthly magazine that will be introduced in January, was supposed to describe the structure of the coalition for the closing luncheon audience. But when she rose to speak, she said simply, ''Nobody is going to want to hear about committees and structure and budgets. This is simply a day of joy.''",

The hunger strikes were the central issue in the campaign there, and the news from the prison seemed to strengthen the determination of the voters backing Owen Carron, who is running as ''the prisoners' candidate.'' Black Flags in Province\n\n''Mickey's death reminds us of the reason we've got to back Owen,'' a campaign worker said after hanging up one of the many black flags that appeared around the district and the rest of the province this morning.\n\nIn Belfast and Londonderry, the news of Mr. Devine's death was spread through Roman Catholic neighborhoods by women blowing whistles and banging garbage can lids on the pavement, a traditional form of protest. There were also sporadic outbreaks of violence, with gangs of youths throwing gasoline bombs and rocks at the police. But the disorders were widely scattered, and easily contained.\n\nMr. Devine was serving a 12-year sentence for various terroristrelated crimes, including the possession of explosives and ammunition. Like two other hunger strikers who died, he was a member of the Irish National Liberation Army, a breakaway group that is regarded as somewhat more hard-line than the Irish Republican Army.\n\nA native of Londonderry, he was married and had two children. He spent the last four years in the Maze Prison, refusing to wear clothes or to cooperate in any other way with the prison authorities. 6 Hunger Strikers Are Left\n\nHis death left six fasting prisoners. The most vulnerable of them, Laurence McKeown, is expected to die in about a week. Another nationalist, Patrick Quinn, was taken off the hunger strike by his mother last month, when he lost consciousness after six weeks without food. Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A. Provisionals, later said that Mr. Quinn had decided to continue eating when he regained consciousness. Although that decision was an important blow to the solidarity of the hunger strike, the Sinn Fein statement said:\n\n''It has always been likely that one or more of the men would take the decision to end the fast. And it has always been made clear to them that they could end the hunger strike at any time.''\n\nThe by-election in the farming district of County Fermanagh and County Tyrone is to fill a vacancy created by the death last May of Robert Sands, the first of the hunger strikers. He was elected to Parliament last April in a protest vote.\n\nSince Mr. Sands's election, which was a serious disappointment to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Government has enacted a law prohibiting other prisoners from running for Parliament. Mr. Carron, who was Mr. Sands's campaign manager, is running on a platform of support for them.\n\nHis principal opponent, in what is regarded as a close race, is Kenneth Maginnis, a Protestant. The result of the by-election will be known tomorrow afternoon.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Michael Devine photo of children watching a burning truck in Belfast",

Ever since the CARD Act — the personal finance reform law that did away with many anti-consumer practices — took effect in February 2010, free balance transfer credit cards were presumed dead.\n\nCredit card companies had previously relied upon shady tactics like implementing unfair payment allocation and default rates at the drop of a hat to profit off these cards, which offer 0% introductory interest rates on balance transfers and do not charge balance transfer fees.\n\nWith the ability to do so taken away by legislators, the offers faded into oblivion. Their return therefore raises a number of questions, beginning with what sparked the comeback.\n\nThere are a number of possible explanations for what led Chase and Discover to reintroduce free balance transfer offers a couple of months ago, with the leading hypothesis being that they simply want to add balances to their portfolios in order to give the false impression of growth.\n\nWhatever the case may be, you should be asking yourself: How can I benefit?\n\nThe truth is, you can benefit by moving quickly. Free balance transfer credit cards are extremely beneficial in that they allow you to pay off existing debt over the course of a year-plus at absolutely no cost, but they are unlikely to have much staying power due to the aforementioned profitability concerns.\n\nA prime example of this is the No Balance Transfer Fee Discover More Card, which was recently discontinued just about two months after it was first offered.\n\nThe only offer currently available with a 0% APR for more than a year is the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase. It gives you 0% on both purchases and transfers for 15 months and obviously does not charge the standard 3% balance transfer fee assessed by the majority of balance transfer credit cards.\n\nNot only can such terms help you pay down what you owe quicker and at less of a cost than normal, but they also enable you to avoid costly interest on purchases.\n\nIf you wind up applying for this or any such offer - which will require excellent credit for approval, by the way - make sure to pay off any balance before the end of the 0% intro term, at which point high regular rates will take effect.\n\nNot doing so will rob you of the potentially significant savings attainable via a free balance transfer credit card.\n\nOdysseas Papadimitriou is CEO of Card Hub, a website that helps consumers compare credit card offers.",

        "instruction": "ALTHOUGH it seems quite natural that a negative review can damage a restaurant, it may be surprising to learn that a rave sometimes does a kind of damage all its own. Whether because of greed or inexperience, a restaurateur who gets a three-star or four-star rating, may pack the house beyond the capacities and temperaments of its kitchen and dining-room staff. The inevitable result of such action is poor food and rude or careless service, and a spate of justified complaints. It is gratifying, therefore, to discover that Vienna '79, which received a three-star rating last March, not only has been able to cope with success, but also has improved to the point where it well deserves a four-star rating. This despite the fact that the original chef left early in the fall to be replaced by the former sous-chef, Thomas Ferlesch, who is 24 years old.\n\nFull credit for this success belongs to Peter Grunauer, the proprietor, a dedicated cook and student of cuisine. Were he not, a change of chefs could turn this into a brand new restaurant. But Mr. Grunauer's consistent standards and knowledge of the cuisine has bridged the gap between staff changes, and his almost constant presence has kept cooks and waiters working smoothly and professionally.\n\nThe cuisine that Mr. Grunauer has devised for his restaurant could be described as nouvelle Viennoise, styles that at first glance might seem mutually exclusive considering the lightness of the nouvelle cuisine and the heaviness of traditional Austrian fare. But by lightening up on fats and flour, and by garnishing dishes with an unusual rainbow of bright steamed and sauteed vegetables, Mr. Grunauer and his chef are devising what is virtually an original cuisine. It is true that many of the themes considered new by the French chefs who are credited with inventing France's nouvelle cuisine are inherent in Austrian-German cooking. Among these, the most obvious are the accents of sweet and sour fruit sauces with meat dishes, the use of cool-flavored green herbs and aromatic spices such as dill, juniper and caraway, and the frothy. brightly refreshing eisbecher - a sundae of sherbet, fruits and ice cream.\n\nIn addition to the original repertory of dishes developed for this restaurant, new candidates are constantly on the drawing board and both the owner and chef work on their refinement. Mr. Ferlesch, trained in Switzerland and in his native Austria, where he worked at the renowned pastry shop Demel's, is something of a rarity - a chef equally adept at cooking and baking. His Wachau-style snails laced with cream and perfumed with garlic, shallots and parsley, all baked in a crusty kaiser roll, are as inspired as his velvety, moist Sacher torte or his Viennese cheesecake, a fluff of cheese whipped with cream, lemon zest and Grand Marnier spread between layers of a golden sponge cake. Slivers of beef marinated in a vinaigrette dressing and served as a first course salad with crisp threads of green pepper and onion and his perfect, tender but meaty liver dumplings adrift in a lusty consomme require as much craftsmanship and flavoring artistry as his Salzburger nockerl, the cloudlets of souffle baked on a huge silver platter and adrift on a sea of creme Anglaise, or his meltingly rich, warm rahmstrudel, a cream-filled puff of flaky pastry in the same sweet vanilla-scented sauce.\n\nFrom appetizers through desserts, the kitchen's performance almost invariably lives up to the menu's promise. Equally elegant first courses are the sweet, pearly smoked trout with horseradish-spiked whipped cream, or the homemade dill-cured salmon, gravlax, with an appropriate mustard sauce. There is usually a smooth and rich vegetable cream soup - a puree of mushroom, perhaps, or a lush broccoli potage. And the onion soup attains a golden richness rarely found in New York. Homemade head cheese of pork, celery, onions and herbs in aspic generally achieves a delicate perfection; occasionally, however, it is too stiffly set and lacks sufficient meat. Breaded mushrooms, the one dish on which we have had two complaints from readers, generally are as crisply breaded and soothing as this homespun appetizer should be; but once in a while they are overdone and tough. At all times their green herb tartar sauce adds a note of verdant freshness.\n\nFrying is beautifully, greaselessly accomplished, whether for the golden Wiener schnitzel based on tender pink veal or for the Wiener backhuhn, the boneless and flattened breast that makes the world's most elegant fried chicken. Lacy onions, deep fried to match the crisp fragility of spun glass, garnish the rose-rare tender beefsteak (zwiebelrostbraten) as well as the fresh calf's liver slices sauteed with apples. Medallions of veal with mushroom-flecked cream sauce and fork-tender boiled beef (tafelspitz) with chive cream sauce and horseradish sharpened applesauce have been consistenly excellent. And marinated venison, either in a gamy ragout or delicately sauteed, profits from its garnishes of winy red cabbage and half a fresh poached pear jeweled with preserved lingonberries.",

        "instruction": "Companies are realizing that “gamification” — using the same mechanics that hook gamers — is an effective way to generate business. Since the advent of videogames, skeptics have questioned their inherent value: why do players spend hours accruing virtual points working towards intangible rewards?\n\nChalk it up to basic human behavior, which game makers have been trying to understand and appeal to for decades. The more effective a game resonates with users, the better its sales. The developer’s goal is to design a structure and system of rules in which players will a) enjoy the process or journey, and b) create a sense of added value. As gamers and developers have found, a fun process coupled with a system for incentives or rewards for a job well done can become downright addictive.\n\nSo it’s no surprise to some gamers — including yours truly — that the very same game-play mechanics that hook players are slowly wending their way into other parts of the economy, too.\n\nWith “gamification,” companies study and identify natural human tendencies and employ game-like mechanisms to give customers a sense that they’re having fun while working towards a rewards-based goal. In doing so, they hope the added value will enable and reinforce positive behavioral change across a wide spectrum of non-game-related issues — healthcare, finance, philanthropy, general lifestyle.\n\nProponents of “gamification” consider conventional incentive-based mechanics to be flawed, broken, or skewed. In healthcare, some employers and health plans have tried to drive down prescription drug costs by raising copayment fees and thereby “encouraging” members to use cheaper drugs. Certainly these companies are incentivizing, but for all the wrong reasons. They’re about cost efficiency instead of making people healthier and addressing problems like obesity.\n\n“It’s a paradigm that needs to be shifted,” says Adam Dole, a researcher for Method, a design firm. “I think looking at gaming in order to re-frame the incentive structure and getting people to change their behavior to support the desired change is something we need in order for the system to be healthier.”\n\nChange has been slow in coming, but it’s happening nonetheless across industries with a variety of approaches. Here are a few examples: Personal finance rewards. Launched in 2007, Mint.com transformed personal finance into a game, making managing one’s money more fun with a unique approach and attractive interface. Saving towards a trip to Hawaii? Choose that option from a menu, and as you deposit more funds towards toward it, a gauge fills, showing you how close you are financially to hopping that plane. Mint also gives each user a total financial score that encourages financially responsible behavior. Scores spike if users perform financially responsible acts — save money, avoid bank fees, come under budget — and drop if they do the opposite. Users also have the option of competing with other members who have similar goals. To date, the site claims more than 1.5 million active users, and last year, Intuit, maker of TurboTax, acquired it for $170 million.\n\nProfiting from workout goals. When Nike released Nike + in 2008, it “gamified” exercise. Place the pedometer in a pair of (Nike) sneaks and it monitors distance, pace and calories burned, transmitting that data to the user’s iPod. The Nike software loaded on the iPod will then “reward” users if they reach a milestone. If a runner beats his 5-mile distance record, an audio clip from Tour de France cycling champ Lance Armstrong congratulates him. Users can also upload their information online, discuss achievements with other users, and challenge them to distance or speed competitions. To date, Nike has moved well over 1.3 million Nike + units. A new kind of customer reward. In March of 2009, creators Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai released the free, location-based social network, Foursquare. The mobile app encourages people to report in wherever they are. As incentives, Crowley and Selvadurai originally created 16 virtual badges awarded to users based on the number of points they accrue. Frequent the same shop four times in a row and get a “Bender” badge; send 5 birthday shout-outs to other Foursquare members and receive the “16 Candles” crest. And if a particular user happens to be the member who checks into a location the most, they become that spot’s “Mayor.” To entice the social network’s 2-million-plus user base, some businesses now award those who check in from their venue with discounts and promotions. Case in point: the Gap retail chain held a one-day “BlackMagic Event,” which gave Foursquare users a 25% discount off all clothes.\n\nThe ultimate education contest. In July of 2009, President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced Race to the Top, a $4.35 billion points-based grant program from the Department of Education designed to encourage education reform on state and local levels. Each state application is worth a maximum total of 500 points, based on criteria like teacher effectiveness, turnaround of lowest-achieving schools and the use of data to improve instruction. States with the highest points are eligible for portions of the $4.35 billion funding. During the first round of winners in March, Tennessee and Delaware won the first round: Tennessee walked away with $500 million and Delaware won $100 million. Last week, ten states won the second round, including Ohio, Maryland, New York and Hawaii. New York, which was awarded $700 million, promised in its grant application it would increase the total number of charter schools from 200 to 460.\n\nOnce effectively implemented, “gamified” businesses, programs and products prove that people respond positively to this new level of engagement. Unlike in most games where there’s only one winner, successfully gamified programs will result in a win-win situation, both for the company and the consumer.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 26— With his far-reaching initiative for shifting Federal programs to the states, President Reagan has signaled his determination to press forward with ''the Reagan revolution'' in government and has moved to try to dominate the legislative agenda in the face of recession and a restless election-year Congress. In a State of the Union Message that culmin ated weeks of internal debate, Mr. Reagan overruled the White House staff and economic advisers who urged him to combat ballooning F ederal deficits by increasing excise taxes. And he took the risk that later this year Congress would see deficits as its top priori ty and try to take the political initiative from him.\n\nTacitly, by changing his emphasis from the budget and tax cutting battles of 1981 to what he calls his ''new federalism,'' the President was adapting to the economic reality that he could not produce ''a quick fix'' for the economy and the political reality that Congressional majorities would probably balk at another round of huge budget cuts. Allies and foes alike saw his initiative as an effort to divert attention from the projected budget deficits of nearly $100 billion in this fiscal year.\n\nIn his 45-minute address, Mr. Reagan returned to his inuagural theme that his primary personal mission was to slow the growth of Federal spending and reduce the size of the Federal Government, and emphasized that the economic downturn had not shaken his faith in tax-cut, supply-side economics. 'I Don't Believe We Should'\n\nHe seemed to be answering his own inner circle firmly and forcefully when he declared: ''The doubters would have us turn back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax-rate reductions already passed by this Congress. Raise present taxes to cut future deficits, they tell us. Well, I don't believe we should buy their argument.''\n\nThat stirred no applause from the Congressional audience. Nor did his warning to advocates of tax increases that this approach would not lower deficits or balance the budget but would only slow economic growth, reduce production and destroy future jobs.\n\nThe applause finally came when he asserted that he would ''seek no new tax increases this year,'' though later he qualified this by proposing that Congress close tax loopholes and tighten the minimum business tax. His aides estimate that would yield $31 billion in tax revenues in 1983 and 1984.\n\nQuite purposefully, however, the President exhorted the public to be patient with his economic recovery program despite the recession and he sought to throw the political spotlight on his proposal to turn over $47 billion in 40 Federal programs to the states.\n\nGiven the tough economic situation and the partisan m ood in Congress, the President's political strategists calculate that this is the best w ay for Mr. Reagan to sustain political momentum after his first yea r.\n\n''This represents the fifth installment on the President's mandate,'' James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, said. ''Last year, he cut spending, he cut taxes, he cut regulations and he strengthened defense. The fifth thing he wanted to do was return power to the states. This fundamental realignment of the Federal system is a dramatic and bold initiative, and I think it's going to allow us to dominate the debate.'' Michel Cites an Election Year\n\nBut an immediate omen came from the House Republican leader, Robert M. Michel of Illinois. While backing the President's proposal, he noted that it did not directly address the nation's economic plight in an election year.\n\n''This is right in line with Republican dogma,'' Mr. Michel said, ''but my enthusiasm has to be muted a bit because it doesn't create one new job now. It's a partial answer to the long-range problem but it does not do anything for the immediate problem.''\n\nNot only Republican Congressional leaders but even White House officials concede that, as Congress approaches early votes on raising the debt ceiling or adopting a 1983 budget resolution, the deficit issue could take precedence and touch off bipartisan efforts to cut military spending or raise taxes.\n\nBoth moderate Northern ''gypsy moth'' Republicans such as Representative Bill Green of Manhattan and conservative Southern ''boll weevil'' Democrats like Representative G.V. Montgomery of Mississippi forecast pressure on the President to cut military spending to restrain deficits.\n\n''I see some signs that Republicans in both House and Senate might work with Democrats if the problem of the deficits and interest rates is not addressed head-on,'' said Representative James R. Jones of Oklahoma, the House Budget Committee chairman. They Saw Little Alternative\n\nPresidential aides conceded that Mr. Reagan might have more problems dominating the political arena this year than last but decided that they had little alternative but to come up with a series of initiatives with the ''new federalism'' as the centerpiece, to gain the upper hand politically. ''I think we can hold the initiative this y ear,'' one White House official, said. ''We're not naive. It's going to be tough. But we think we can get a good portion of this progr am passed. And if we hadgone up there with just more budget cuts, we would lose the momentum in five days.''\n\nBut the ''new federalism'' package faces a long, arduous legislative fight, especially with Democrats in a partisan mood, as they indicated in their prepackaged, nationally televised critique of Mr. Reagan tonight. Because it touches many programs, it will have to be approved by a host of Congressional committees and is likely to take up most of the year's session.\n\nWorried about the impact on New York, Mr. Green said that Congress would have to insure that the tax revenues Mr. Reagan was turning over to the states would grow as rapidly as the programs that are being turned over and also that Northern states would not be hurt by having other states adopt lower standards for programs like food stamps and welfare.\n\nRecalling the comment by David A. Stockman, the budget director, that the 1981 Reagan tax program was ''a Trojan Horse'' for traditional Republican economics, Mr. Green said: ''If Stockman put together this gift horse for the states, we will want to look at it in the teeth very closely.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of President and Mrs. Reagan 027-20-42",

It is always there, always the same ideal size, ever to be counted upon. Not only is it counted upon, but it is loved. Who would wish it changed?\n\nEven so, that stuff about ''the unchanging Frick'' needs qualification. The Frick changes all the time, but subtly. A cleaned painting here, a discreet loan there, a re-hang that makes the collection sing a new song. Not long ago the Frick even got an extension, but not one that the passer-by would notice. It also got a garden, designed by the late Russell Page, that is a yearlong delight.\n\nIt has loan exhibitions, too. But there, likewise, subtlety prevails. The hideous word ''blockbuster'' has never been spoken at the Frick. Magic is made, but on the scale of chamber music - a collection of vintage clocks, for instance, or eight marble busts by Houdon, or a group of Clodion statuettes. The latest in that series is called ''Ingres and the Comtesse d'Haussonville,'' and it is the work of Edgar Munhall, curator at the Frick.\n\nIngres's portrait of the Comtesse d'Haussonville has always stood out, even in the Frick. As a portrait, it touches perfection, as much in its many passages of still life as in the unforced and meditative elegance of the standing figure. The sitter had the distinction of being the great-granddaughter of Jacques Necker, who had served Louis XVI as director-general of finances, and the grand-daughter of Madame de Stael, in her day one of the most fascinating women in Europe. But she was also a remarkable person in her own right and the author, among much else, of a two-volume life of Byron and an unpublished autobiography that is remarkable for wit, candor and breadth of perception.\n\nShe read all the new books. She went to the new plays (beginning with the celebrated first night of Victor Hugo's ''Hernani,'' when she was only 11), and to the opera, where she manifested better judgment than many a professional critic. (She was a pianist who had known Chopin.) She was a gifted watercolorist who could tackle scenes from high drama and not make a fool of herself.\n\nThough fascinating, she was not at all puffed up. How many beautiful women would admit, as she did, that she had been accused at the age of 9 of having a character that ''had not enough nourishment in it to sustain a dog''? (The same severe critic likened her successively to ''a field mouse, a topaz, a roe deer, a blue fairy and a spark,'' and told her that she should have a runaway horse as her true heraldic emblem.) Madame d'Haussonville never lost, moreover, the delicate sweet roundness of person that prompted her mother to tell her in childhood that she was ''a pretty vase without handles.'' Altogether, she was not the easiest of sitters - above all for Ingres, who had very high standards in portraiture and once said to his pupil Amaury-Duval that nothing in the world was more difficult than to paint a woman's portrait. ''It can't be done,'' he said. ''It's enough to make one weep.'' No one could guess from the tranquillity and resolution of the final image that Ingres went through agony to get it right. The portrait was begun in the summer of 1842, when the sitter was just 24, and it was not finished till three summers later. Everything was against it. Ingres didn't want to paint portraits at all, because he had bigger and more ambitious projects in mind. The sitter went abroad for months on end. There was a long pause while she had a baby. Ingres liked to monitor every last nuance of face and bearing when he was working on a portrait, and we know from his preliminary drawings that he would make as many as 11 amendments on the basis of a single pencil sketch of the face. He did nothing in a hurry.\n\nThen there was the pose to be considered. Edgar Munhall traces it in essence to a Roman statue of modesty (Pudicity, to be precise) that is in the Vatican collections in Rome. Ingres used the same pose in his ''Antiochus and Stratonice,'' which Madame d'Haussonville and her husband had seen in Rome. Conceivably, he was also influenced, as Robert Rosenblum suggests in his book on Ingres, by a Roman copy of a Greek statue of Polyhymnia which is in the Louvre. As a keen student of the Muses, Madame d'Haussonville had much in common with Polyhymnia. Be that as it may, the specific disposition of the sitter's arms and hands and the ruminative tilt of her head were ideally suited to his view of her character.\n\nIt should be said here that at no time since it was painted has the creative process behind this great portrait been studied in such detail, or set before the visitor with such a profusion of evidence, as is the case in the current exhibition at the Frick. Mr. Munhall has been able to borrow 15 of the surviving 16 preliminary drawings, together with the early oil sketch that was sold at auction in Paris just five months ago. He has researched the family history, sitter's dress, the fashion plates of the day, the bracelet, the upholstered chimneypiece, the serpent ring, the comb, the shawl, the porcelain on the chimneypiece, the ormolu-mounted Oriental vases, the opera-glasses, the candle-sconce, the flowers in the cachepot, the visiting cards and even the bell push on its long and elegant rope.",

        "output": "''Nothing ever changes at the Frick,'' people say, and they mean it as a compliment. Among the huge mutations of the world, the Frick is a constant. It is always there, always the same ideal size, ever to be counted upon. Not only is it counted upon, but it is loved. Who would wish it changed?   Even so, that stuff about ''the unchanging Frick'' needs qualification. The Frick changes all the time, but subtly. A cleaned painting here, a discreet loan there, a re-hang that makes the collection sing a new song. Not long ago the Frick even got an extension, but not one that the passer-by would notice. It also got a garden, designed by the late Russell Page, that is a yearlong delight.   It has loan exhibitions, too. But there, likewise, subtlety prevails. The hideous word ''blockbuster'' has never been spoken at the Frick. Magic is made, but on the scale of chamber music - a collection of vintage clocks, for instance, or eight marble busts by Houdon, or a group of Clodion statuettes. The latest in that series is called ''Ingres and the Comtesse d'Haussonville,'' and it is the work of Edgar Munhall, curator at the Frick."

        "instruction": "Of the 9.6 million parking tickets issued in New York City last year, representing $157 million in fines, one-third cannot be processed by the city. This means that some $50 million in fines will probably never be collected.\n\nThe most common reason a ticket cannot be handled is that it is partly illegible or because incorrect information is filled in by the police officer or traffic agent who issues it. In many cases, the incorrect tickets have led to the dunning of innocent motorists, some from out of state, whose license varied from the offender's plate by one digit or letter.\n\nThe Parking Violations Bureau, saddled with obsolete and inflexible computer systems, has also found it difficult to keep track of unpaid tickets that are turned over to private collection agencies. An internal working document on the bureau's problems noted that ''we tend to lose track of a summons once assig ned to agency.''\n\nFurthermore, an undetermined number of motorists evade such fines by selling their automobiles or transferring the title to relatives. Measures that the city has introduced in the State Legislature to surmount this problem have repeatedly been defeated.\n\nAnd while there is more than $800 million in uncollected parking tickets, the bureau has had to write off 80 percent of them as bad debts.\n\nThese defects in the country's largest parking violations bureau were acknowledged recently by its director, Lester N. Shafran. But while Mr. Shafran conceded that things were not going perfectly at the bureau, he said he believed that major improvements had been made. The surest measure of that success, he said, is the increased volume of collections - from $78.4 million in the fiscal year 1976 to $93.2 million last year.\n\nBut Mr. Shafran acknowledged that the bureau's antiquated computer system, which dates from the late 1960's and is not expected to be replaced until June 1983, is a major source of problems.\n\nAmong the difficulties he cited are the following:\n\n- The bureau's data system cannot automatically eliminate obvious errors.\n\n- The computer system is inflexible, and it is difficult to adapt new computer programs for ticket collection.\n\n- The bureau depends on the computers of the State Department of Motor Vehicles for registration information for each license plate. The illegibility of tickets is compounded by errors made by keypunch operators who enter the information into computers. Officials at the violations bureau estimate that the key-punch error rate is between 2 and 3 percent, which means that more than 200,000 tickets were incorrectly entered last year.\n\nIn defending his agency, Mr. Shafran said that until 1978, only 54 percent of the tickets issued could be processed by the bureau, substantially fewer than the current 66 percent that are now properly written. Although 3.2 million tickets could not be automatically processed by the bureau last year, he said, an effort is made to decipher illegibly written summonses individually.\n\n''A lot of tickets are not written properly, sloppily,'' Mr. Shafran said. ''A '3' looks like a '5,' a 'u' looks like a 'v,' an 'I' looks like a '1.' Legibility is a big factor.'' Problems With Abbreviations\n\nAnother frequent mistake, he said, is confusing the abbreviations for states that begin with the same letter. Although the Postal Service has established 'ME' as the abbreviation for Maine and 'MA' for Massachusetts, ticket writers often confuse the two, Mr. Shafran said. Similar instances of confusion are cited for states like Nebraska and Nevada, and for Washington, D.C., and the state of Washington.\n\nCases in which letters and numbers are transposed are also frequently found, Mr. Shafran said. That mistakes abound was evident in a demonstration outside City Hall on Sept. 3 by irate Massachusetts motorists who contended they had been dunned by the bureau and collection agencies for parking tickets issued to them by mistake.\n\nJohn Restuccia, a fireman from Waltham, Mass., brandished a sheaf of computer printouts showing he owed more than $26,591 for unpaid tickets. The only problem, he pointed out, is that he had not been in New York City since 1965, when he traveled through on a bus. Twice as Many Hearings\n\nLast year, Parking Violations Bureau examiners held 560,000 hearings on contested tickets, nearly double the number held in 1978. Some of that increase may stem from the widespread error rate. ''If there is anything wrong with the information on a ticket, it has to be thrown out,'' Mr. Shafran said.\n\nSince 1978, the dismissal rate at the administrative hearings for parking tickets has risen from 5 percent to 35 percent. Mr. Shafran attributed the increase to the introduction of more careful procedures in the bureau, saying, ''We throw out stuff that doesn't stick.''\n\nThe bureau also has introduced a ''write-off policy,'' according to Mr. Shafran, that determines what tickets can be collected. This year, the bureau wrote off $160 million in tickets dating from 1970 to 1973, according to Jon Silverberg, the director of policy analysis.\n\n''If we can't get a name and address,'' Mr. Silverberg said, ''the ticket is uncollectable and we have to write it off.'' In an effort to clear the bureau's books of older tickets, Mr. Shafran said, if ''a ticket is more than two years and seven days old, w e consider it dead.''\n\n''It's the law,'' he added. 'We're More Respectable'\n\nMr. Shafran was reluctant to attribute the rising number of hearings to incorrectly filled-in tickets, preferring to ascribe the jump to a streamlining of the process and the improved image of the bureau, and an increased willingness among people who receive tickets to fight them.\n\n''People are coming out because we're more respectable,'' he asserted. ''A ticket is thought of negatively, psychologically. You don't want to get it, and when you do, you don't want to pay it. We've suffered from that unhappiness.''\n\n''The enormous issuance of tickets in the mid-70's flooded the P.V.B.,'' he said. ''It got a terrible reputation. We were accused of being a kangaroo forum in hearing ticket cases. They said a ticket was a dollar bill on wheels. There were a lot of cheap shots.\n\n''When I came in 1978, the P.V.B. was under investigation for using collection agencies that used heavy-handed tactics,'' he continued. ''This is what we have had to fight.'' 'Potential for Abuse'\n\nThroughout the city's government, officials say privately that the bureau has a long way to go in solving its problems. An audit of the agency to be released soon by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan accuses it of being ''loose about its record-keeping,'' with a ''potential for abuse'' by private collection agencies under contract to the bureau.\n\nA senior official in the Comptroller's office, who declined to be named, said that in response to the audit, which has already been shown to the bureau, the agency had promised to tighten up its procedures.\n\nMr. Shafran and Mr. Silverberg assert that the bureau has adequate controls over the 15 collection agencies to which the uncollected tickets are assigned.\n\n''We do audits of the collection agencies, the City Comptroller and the State Comptroller do audits,'' Mr. Silverberg said. But both Richard Piperno, a spokesman for City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, and Bonnie Graham, a spokesman for the State Comptroller, said their offices had conducted no direct audits of the private collection agencies under contract to the bureau.",

Fifteen years, one month and four days after she landed on \"Live!\" and 150 days after she announced she was quitting, Kathie Lee Gifford said her final-final-final farewells yesterday, as cheeky and chipper as the day she first tripped onto the set in a red chiffon dress and white running shoes.\n\n\"This has been the longest goodbye in the history of the world. Enough!\" Kathie Lee said in mock disgust as she settled into her co-host chair, wearing a red halter-top dress with a plunging neckline.\n\nBut there was no sign she had wearied of the task. After a lunch at Gabriel's Thursday with the Kathie Lee Fan Club and dinner at Tavern on the Green with the \"Regis and Kathie Lee\" staff, the daytime diva roared in yesterday to a studio so jammed with Kathie-philes that audience, employees, press and VIPs had to be issued separate color-coded IDs.\n\n\"Being a fan of hers has changed my life,\" enthused Tina Terzano of Northfield, N.J., who showed up without a ticket at 3:10 AM, hoping to squeeze into the studio. (She did - and wept openly.) \"I love her strength, her morals.\"\n\nOf course, it wasn't just rank-and-file Kathie-watchers who praised the goodbye girl.\n\nEarly in the week, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart quipped that they were rushing to finish the Camp David summit in time for the show.\n\nYesterday, Mayor Giuliani - a frequent guest, but a no-show this time - issued a proclamation declaring it Kathie Lee Gifford Day.\n\nAnd her ultimate boss, Disney chairman Michael Eisner, presented her with a \"Mousecar\" (as in Oscar), a silver Mickey Mouse statue that he said has been awarded only five times since Walt Disney himself designed it.\n\nBut, ultimately, this curtain- closer was a family affair. Kathie Lee's parents, Joan and Aaron Epstein, were there. So were Cody and \"Cassi-diva,\" as she called the kids whose lives became grist for her morning chatter and fodder for her critics. So was Frank, whose 1997 infidelity sent the supermarket tabs into overdrive and Kathie Lee reeling.\n\nAnd in a week in which the star steadfastly refused to cry, it was Regis Philbin who finally brought Kathie Lee to tears, with his version of \"Thanks for the Memory.\" He sang about her \"Hee Haw Honey\" days. He suggested that the Emmy voters - who regularly snubbed them - could \"kiss our a--.\" And he left her weeping when he crooned, \"Please recall, I love you so much.\"\n\n\"Over a third of my life has been here,\" Kathie Lee said afterward, explaining her mistiness. \"This is family. It's been been an amazing journey.\"\n\nBut one that wasn't about to end. With entourage in tow, she zipped over to \"The View,\" where Meredith Vieira dabbed at fake tears while Barbara Walters promised Kathie Lee's very, very, very, very last appearance on TV - \"until she goes on to that sitcom.\" (Actually, Kathie Lee announced she'll do a \"Will and Grace\" episode this fall.)\n\nSo how did Kathie Lee top Kathie Lee? With a quickie star turn, in which she showed off her goodbye note from Kevin Costner and her goodbye gift from Regis, a Tiffany frame with a photo of them in wedding duds. Finally, it was time for the man who, in the pre-scandal days, she endlessly described as her Prince Charming. \"Let's get the hell out of here,\" said Frank, bearing a giant bouquet of roses. \"We're going home.\"\n\nIt's not likely for long.",

Up to now, the major concerns of the candidates have been raising money, putting together a campaign staff, wooing the party professionals and gauging the strengths, weaknesses and durability of their opponents.\n\nBut now the candidates and their consultants are talking about the start of the ''public'' campaign, and they use terms like ''penetration.'' If that sounds painful, it could be.\n\nIt means watching political campaign commercials on television during timeouts of the professional basketball playoffs, digging a proliferation of campaign brochures and position papers out of the mailbox and getting campaign appeals at the front door or by telephone.\n\nIt could become irritating because of the volume of candidates, but it is also necessary. Polls show that the voters know virtually nothing about the candidates for the state's top executive position, even if they recognize their names.\n\nThus far, only four candidates have gone on television to get their faces and names before the voters. They are Joseph A. Sullivan of Essex Fells and State Senator James H. Wallwork of Short Hills in the Republican race and Representative James J. Florio of Runnemede and State Senator Joseph P. Merlino of Trenton in the Democratic contest.\n\nCuriously, Representative Robert A. Roe, Democrat of Wayne, the candidate who made the greatest use of television four years ago, has decided to spend his money this time on organization, mailing, targeting likely voters and following up with personal contacts by volunteers.\n\nMr. Roe also has said that he will not accept public financing. This gives him a political issue to use in these times of tight budgets, but it also requires him to raise $3 for each $1 raised by his opponents.\n\nSome consultants contend that it is impossible to win an election, especially one as crowded as this one, without television. They say that it imparts ''star quality'' to a candidate and reinforces the other aspects of the campaign.\n\nWhen Mr. Roe ran in 1977, his television commercials made the Democratic primary race look like a contest between him and Governor Byrne, even though there were 10 candidates. He finished second and, on the strength of that, is one of the favorites in the current campaign.\n\nMr. Roe originally indicated this year that he would pass up television altogether, but now some aides say there will be television commercials later in the campaign.\n\nJohn J. Degnan, the former Attorney General who is trying to follow his mentor, Mr. Byrne, will rely on David Garth, the New York consultant whose television campaign for Mr. Byrne in 1977 helped the Governor win re-election.\n\nBefore the votes are counted on June 2, Mr. Degnan and Mr. Sullivan could become two of the most familiar public figures in New Jersey, especially if they follow through on their plans for television campaigns.\n\nWhether their planned television exposure is enough to win a primary election remains to be seen. Neither man has a recognizable political base to build on, and their success - or lack of it - could serve as a benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of mass marketing in a primary campaign vs. the well-worn path of working through the established party organizations.",

Is a shakeout at hand?\n\nYou might think it is after reading a report Tuesday from the New York Times, which points out that Goldman’s GS partners sold $108 million of stock in December and January. That’s up 42% from their sales in October and November.\n\nThat isn’t a huge amount of selling at a firm whose average daily trading volume approaches $800 million. Of course, this being Goldman, there is the suspicion that the selling could be a sign that partners who won’t be staying with the firm are cashing out as they prepare to spend quality time with family or, perhaps less upliftingly, elsewhere in the business world.\n\nGoldman’s partnership pool is a relic from before its 1999 initial public offering, when the firm was a limited partnership whose leaders shared the firm’s profits and stood ready to commit capital when Goldman lost money.\n\nUnder the post-IPO arrangement, Goldman’s partners – technically managing director partners – share a piece of the firm’s profits and get the right to invest in some choice deals. Their compensation can run well into the millions of dollars, largely in stock they can’t sell immediately.\n\nWith last fall’s class of 110 new members, Goldman has its biggest group of managing director partners ever. The firm says it doesn’t disclose the size of its partnership group, but the Times report puts the current number at 483.\n\nThat’s up from a reported 443 in 2008 – a class that was named in the midst of the financial meltdown – and media reports ranging between 267 and 320 in the middle of the past decade. The firm discloses how many people join the pool with each biennial class and says they stay on average for about eight years or so. But it doesn’t say how many leave, which makes the size of the pool at any given moment a moving target.\n\nA bigger class at a time of squeezed profits seems to point toward an inevitable thinning of the partner ranks. Partners who have been around for a bit aren’t going to want to see their checks get soaked by having too many people in the bonus pool.\n\nAt the same time, it’s worth noting that the size of Goldman’s partner class hasn’t changed much as a proportion of the firm’s total workforce. So if profits do hold up, the pressure to trim the partnership list won’t be intense.\n\nThe pool was 221 when the firm went public in 1999, for instance. That’s 1.7% of the firm’s employment as of February 1999 — compared with 1.4% now.\n\nGoldman will surely bring in another hundred or so hard hitters in 2012, and there’s going to have to be room to give them their cut of the Goldman pie without whittling down the existing partners’ pieces. Not everyone is going to make that cut, obviously.\n\nAll the same, you’re not exactly likely to see a bunch of ex-partners sporting sandwich boards any time soon, either.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @ColinCBarr.",

        "instruction": "ONE of the most valuable diagnostic procedures doctors can do is free of risks, involves no advanced technology and costs only the time it takes to ask pertinent questions.\n\nThis procedure is the taking of the family history as part of the medical history. Its importance for the patient as well as for grandchildren and future generations increases each passing year as more is learned about the hereditary nature of many common disorders and as newer therapies become available for them.\n\nUnfortunately, despite repeated warnings at lectures and in medical journals, doctors overlook the family history all too often - to the potential detriment of the health of patients as well as their families.\n\nThe only tools the doctor needs are paper and pencil as he records the family treeand probes for diagnostic clues to ailments that may affect the patient and blood relatives. Although ways of taking a family history may differ from one doctor to another, the questions are usually straightforward. For example:\n\n- Are your mother and father alive and well? If not, what ails them? If deceased, what did they die of?\n\n- Are all your brothers and sisters alive? Were there any who died? From what?\n\n- Does any relative have the same problem that you do?\n\n- Is there any disorder that runs through your family?\n\n- Is there a genetic disorder that affects your family?\n\n- What is the ethnic origin of the family, if known? The answers may lead to even more questions. For example, the doctor might also ask if relatives had married each other in a patient's family, or if there was a common last name on both sides of the family.\n\nPeriodically, doctors update and review the family history because it can provide a wealth of information that can be, in some cases, more important than anything they do in a physical examination or a laboratory test.\n\nFor example, now that public health officials have developed screening programs to detect and treat hypertension, more doctors have begun to ask if other members of the family are known to have had high blood pressure. Such a record can help prevent death at an early age and ward off strokes and kidney disease.\n\nSimilarly, doctors may ask if a blood relative has had a heart attack prematurely, say at the age of 50. If so, the physician would carefully examine, among other areas, the skin around the eyes and on the arms and feet for yellow discolorations resulting from deposits of fat.\n\nThe physician would check for risk factors by, for example, repeating blood pressure readings and ordering tests to measure lipids, cholesterol and other substances in the blood. And then, depending on circumstances in each case, the physician might advise changes in diet and other habits.\n\nThe family history can often be helpful in diagnosing, even preventing some cancers. Although cancer is very common and is bound to affect someone somewhere in most families, a few cancers occur in a pattern known as autosomal dominant inheritance. In such family cancer syndromes, each child born to an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of developing the condition.\n\nKnowing the hereditary nature of many common diseases sometimes leads physicians to advise examining other family members as a form of preventive medicine.\n\nConsider Wilson's disease, a rare disorder in which an enzyme defect leads to a toxic accumulation of copper and damages the liver, brain and other organs. It can be successfuly treated with Dpenicillamine. Because such drug therapy can benefit affected individuals before the damage is evident, doctors seek undetected cases among blood relatives who have abnormally large amounts of copper but have not yet manifested symptoms of the disorder.\n\nInherited disorders can lead to abnormal responses to drugs. One example is malignant hyperthermia. Affected people have no symptoms unless they receive an anesthetic gas. Then the body temperature can rapidly shoot to as high as 107 degrees. In some forms, each child born to an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of having the same condition. When such a reaction occurs, warnings are issued to other blood relatives.\n\nSeveral years ago, when I investigated an unusual hereditary disorder that damages the eyes, skin and blood vessels, I traveled around the country to examine relatives of my patients for the disorder called P.X.E. (pseudoxanthoma elasticum). I detected several previously unsuspected cases among people who knew the condition ran in their families. Some had not told their doctors. Others had, but their doctors failed to recognize it.\n\nSuch an example shows how a diagnosis sometimes becomes apparent only when a doctor reviews the medical records or physically examines all family members. This is particularly true in disorders affecting the central nervous system. Because some cases can be mild, the disorder may not be correctly diagnosed unless all the evidence is examined in a family context.\n\nIf family history can be so valuable, why do so many doctors pass it over so lightly? Among the reasons: There is little financial incentive to take the time to work out a family history in this technological era when doctors can earn bigger fees by ordering electrocardiograms and other tests.\n\nAlthough it is the physician who should customarily ask about a family history, you can do yourself a favor by thinking about the ailments affecting your relatives before a visit to the doctor. Then, if your doctor does not ask, raise the point.\n\nThere are far too many hereditary disorders to list here. In considering any such disorder, though, it is important to keep in mind that not all family clusters of an illness stem from genetic factors. The familial occurrence of a disease can be a result of common environmental exposure of several family members to the same infectious or toxic agent.\n\nIllustrations: chart of sample family medical history",

        "instruction": "MANAGUA, Nicaragua— In the days when Nicaragua's private sector tipped the balance in the struggle against the Somoza regime by organizing crippling strikes and helping to persuade the Carter Administration of the popularity and justice of the rebel cause, Sandinist guerrillas considered business's political role a patriotic one.\n\nTwo years after the guerrilla victory, however, the regime and the private sector are sniping at each other about the depressed state of the economy and the direction of the revolution. The businessmen's political interventions are no longer welcomed. Now they are being told to worry about production and leave politics to the Government.\n\nShrunk by a flight of executives, weakened by Government confiscations and bruised by rhetorical combat with the regime, the private sector nevertheless still controls half the economy and constitutes the principal political opposition in Nicaragua today. ''We're very much alive,'' said Enrique Dreyfus, a business spokesman, ''though not very well.''\n\nLast week, in the first high-level contact between the Reagan Administration and the Sandinist Government, Thomas O. Enders, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, paid a 30-hour visit to Managua and apparently came away surprised to find an outspoken and forceful opposition still active.\n\nThe main thrust of Mr. Enders's message to the Government was that any improvement in the sour relations with the Reagan Administration would depend on a total cutoff of purported Nicaraguan arms shipments to Salvadoran guerrillas and a freeze in Nicaragua's own arms buildup. But his discovery that a mixed economy and political pluralism both survive could also prompt some revision of Washington's prevailing perception that Nicaragua is already ''lost'' to the Soviet camp.\n\nIndeed, the continuing commitment of the Sandinists to a mixed economy reflects their recognition that the Soviet model does not offer solutions to the chronic problems of underdevelopment inherited from the Somoza regime.\n\nNicaraguan lefists have observed both the Soviet Union and China reintroduce capitalist incentives in the hope of raising production. They have seen political stability decimated by economic troubles in Poland. And they have heard Cuba's President Fidel Castro, their most trusted mentor, urge them to preserve a private sector.\n\nBut, having seized power in a country where every change of government has been through force of arms, the Sandinists are clearly less enthused by the idea of political pluralism that could result in their being voted out of office. The current crisis, then, has been provoked by a short circuit in the links between the mixed economy and political pluralism: both exist, but neither is flourishing.\n\nPart of the problem stems from the fact that, unlike the situation in El Salvador where the left has long used class warfare as an instrument for seizing power, the true revolution in Nicaragua began when the Sandinists took over. Only then did they start organizing the peasant and worker masses for the struggle against the ''bourgeoisie.''\n\nThe private sector, willing to accept gradual reforms, was taken aback by the sudden radicalization. Some businessmen, although opponents of the Somoza regime, immediately left the country. Others reopened their factories but refused to invest and not a few found illegal ways of sending savings and profits to banks abroad, effectively decapitalizing many companies.\n\n''I've collected $80,000 abroad since the revolution,'' a young executive said. ''Why shouldn't I? If I'm being called a bourgeois, an exploiter, a counterrevolutionary all day long on radio and television, I have to be prepared for what might happen tomorrow. The Government gives us economic incentives, but what we want is a climate of political confidence.''\n\nThe Sandinists have taken increasingly to blaming the private sector for the economic crisis, although mismanagement by a bloated bureaucracy, low world prices for commodity exports, a slump among Nicaragua's traditional trading partners in Central America and high interest rates for foreign credits are also key factors. The attitude of local businessmen, though, is one variable that the Government can change.\n\nThe regime's strategy has been to try to separate businessmen from the political opposition in the hope of persuading them to invest. To date this strategy has failed. The umbrella organization for 114 small business associations, known by its Spanish acronym of Cosep, remains closely allied with opposition political parties, the independent newspaper, La Prensa, and conservatives in the Roman Catholic Church led by Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua. The business group's main demands are essentially political, not least definition of the ground rules for elections the junta has promised in 1985.\n\n''Our political influence derives from our entrepreneurial ability, our continuing control of half of production and our international contacts and credibility,'' explained Jaime Montealegre Lacayo, executive director of Cosep. ''We don't want influence as politicians seeking power. We want to influence the way Nicaragua is governed, mainly economically, but also politically because this also affects the economy.''\n\nThe regime's response to the private sector has been inconsistent. Last month, for example, it confiscated 14 companies that had allegedly been ''decapitalized'' by their owners. But 10 days ago, top Sandanist commanders invited 30 key business leaders to voice their complaints at a private meeting that lasted more than five hours. Similarly, in public, the regime has called for labor discipline, but in practice many companies are still the targets of union agitation.\n\nThe regime argues that it has defined the rules of the game - ''a mixed economy, political pluralism and national unity, not to liquidate or weaken the revolution, but to strengthen it,'' in the words of Tomas Borge Martinez, one of nine top Sandinist commanders. But many Nicaraguan businessmen believe that the very concept of a mixed economy in an embryonic socialist state is simply not realistic.\n\nAt the same time, some businessmen insist that the revolution can only deal with the country's deep social ills by first solving its economic problems; for this, they say, their cooperation is indispensable.\n\nSignificantly, virtually all the executives who have survived the past two years of sudden and often chaotic change say they are determined to remain in Nicaragua. Albeit often with raised voices, the Government and private sector are still talking, and perhaps slowly learning to live with each other.\n\nIllustrations: photo of cotton loading in Corinto graph of Nicaragua's rising inflation and sinking income",

The purchase of the California automaker is scheduled to go before a judge for approval Tuesday.\n\nAt one time, A123 supplied batteries for Fisker’s Karma hybrid, and restarting Fisker’s production line would allow A123 to renew its focus on the automotive market. In recent years, the company shifted toward building more large-scale batteries for the electric grid and for commercial vehicles.\n\nPin Ni, head of Wanxiang America Corp., said the Fisker purchase could help propel the long-term growth that his company promised when it bought A123 out of bankruptcy about a year ago.\n\n“One of the key reasons we wanted to buy this is A123,” Ni said. “A123 is the only supplier to Fisker, and if Fisker wants to make a car in the short term, it was just going to be us, one way or another.”\n\nWanxiang’s plan is to start making the $100,000 luxury Karma, while also looking to build a hybrid car that everyday customers wouldbuy, Ni said. That car would probably be powered by A123’s batteries.\n\n“Fisker will be the foundation for the electrical car for Wanxiang,” Ni said.\n\nWanxiang, which owns several parts factories in the United States, has long been a presence in the auto industry, providing parts for one out of three cars made in America.\n\nIn more recent years, the company has invested in clean technologies, including advanced batteries and solar panels.\n\nThe purchase of Fisker may signal that Wanxiang is not as confident in the performance of A123’s grid-storage division and may be trying to bolster other divisions of the company, said Joshua Paradise, an independent consultant in Boston who used to follow clean technology companies for the Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley\n\nA123’s grid storage division, called A123 Energy Solutions, employs roughly 125 people in Massachusetts.\n\n“Perhaps they’re not seeing the volume or the sales they want to see,” he said.\n\nThe interest in Fisker could also stem from the dream of Wanxiang’s founder, Lu Guanqiu, to build cars. But given the Karma’s previously anemic sales and high cost, the acquisition doesn’t seem to make business sense, Paradise said.\n\n“Fisker is a vanity car,” Paradise said, “and this looks like a vanity purchase.”\n\nCosmin Laslau, an analyst for energy storage at Lux Research in Boston, said a revived Fisker would be “all upside” for A123, but agreed that Wanxiang faces challenges to making the deal work. He estimated it could take hundreds of millions of dollars of investment by Wanxiang to revive and grow Fisker.\n\n“It is a risky play for Wanxiang and A123,” Laslau said. “Fisker is going to need a whole lot more money.”\n\nFisker also has outstanding bills to pay, including a $168 million Department of Energy loan bought last year by Hybrid Tech, the failed bidder.\n\n“Hybrid will consider taking all necessary steps and appropriate measures to protect its interests in this matter,” the company said in a statement it issued Friday.\n\nFisker’s A123-powered cars also would have to compete against those from Tesla Motors, whose popular hybrids run on Panasonic technology, and those from General Motors, which makes the Chevy Volt, powered with LG Chem technology.\n\n“The battery business for cars is all about the right partnership, “Laslau said. “It doesn’t matter if you make a great battery if you don’t have the right partnership.”",

        "instruction": "IN a spirited tribute to the 100th anniversary of Elie Nadelman's birth, the Zabriskie Gallery, 29 West 57th Street, has mounted a show of nearly 100 works by the Polish-born artist (1882-1946), who is now considered to be one of this country's most accomplished sculptors.\n\nIn this, its fifth Nadelman presentation since 1967, the gallery concentrates on the artist's figures and drawings of women, a subject very close to his psyche. The figures here range from nearly lifesize bronzes to tiny, archaicized grotesqueries in clay, and there are 17 drawings recently found in Nadelman's Riverdale studio by his son, Jan, and never before exhibited. Also included are a group of posthumously published drypoint etchings, and six other drawings acquired not long ago from a Paris collection.\n\nThe ''Eternal Feminine'' was a lifelong inspiration for Nadelman, according to his posthumous patron and biographer, Lincoln Kirstein; a goddess who ''breathed the air of temple, throneroom, salon, circus.'' Pursuing this muse, Nadelman took as his models showgirls, burlesque queens, vaudeville hoofers, grande dames, but he also drew from more formal sources: Greek sculpture, Rodin, Seurat, American folk art.\n\nIn both drawings and sculptures, he constructed his female forms of eloquent curves. Their hair is arranged in stylized poufs, their facial planes are arced, their pneumatic busts are set off by equally round derrieres, and they have plump little legs that end in dainty feet, suggesting the bound extremities of old Chinese ladies. ''A woman's form is all curves and rotundity, say the letter O or in profile S,'' he once told an interviewer. Basically a modeler and a carver, he relied on the curved line as a means of reducing human anatomy, and as an antidote to the flat angularities of early Cubism.\n\nThe drawings in the show, done between 1904 and 1925, range from mere sketches to finished works, such as the beautifully modeled ''Woman With a Shawl,'' a head with a heart-shaped face built of line and crosshatching. The sculptures, dating mostly from the mid-1920's, include five large standing or seated figures, one in bronze, the others made by means of a technique known as galvano-plastique, in which bronzelike metal was electroplated onto a plaster core. Nadelman loved to ''quote'' from sculpture of the past, and these figures attitudinize delightfully in gentle burlesque of classic poses.\n\nThere are also a great many examples - too many, for this viewer - of the tiresome mantelpiece figures, often paired women, some of which Nadelman evidently intended for mass reproduction. Blowsy, sketchy and blurred in outline, they are done in painted clay, papier-mache and plaster and derive from a vast range of sources, including pre-Columbian, archaic Greek and even Meissen china. (A grotesquely scaled-up example of this work may be seen in the promenade of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center).\n\nAll in all, by no means a major Nadelman show. But relaxed in approach, and enjoyable. (Through July 16.)\n\nOther shows of interest: Robert Quijada (Ericson Gallery, 23 East 74th Street): An impeccable colorist, Robert Quijada builds his ''collage constructions'' by striating a flat, subtly toned paper surface with glued-on strips of wood and canvas, painted or wrapped in colored thread. The symmetrically divided surface of ''Red Construction,'' for instance, is of embossed paper laid in overlapping sheets in a deep terra cotta tone. Each half of the surface is enriched and accented by a rhythmic arrangement of strips, put down in mirror opposition to the other half. The delicately varying surface of ''White Construction No. 2,'' a horizontal wall piece, is achieved by white linen strips of differing shades and widths, wrapped here and there with green thread.\n\nFor all their elegance, these unabashedly beautiful works put one in mind of ancient Indian textiles; also desert earth and sky. Their craftsmanship is superb. (Through tomorrow.)\n\nMaria Simonds-Gooding (Betty Parsons Gallery, 24 West 57th Street): On a pristine surface of white plaster, Maria Simonds-Gooding drawsincises-paints rudimentary structures in childlike perspective that can be perceived - from the titles of her works - as houses, doorways, ponds, fields, outdoor enclosures. The artist, who lives on a bleak, isolated peninsula on the west coast of Ireland and has spent time in India, evokes a primitive country life at some emotional - as well as geographic - distance from civilization. In the bare-essentials milieu of ''Compound and Dwellings,'' for instance, there are a couple of cockeyed little huts, a fenced enclosure (or is it a pond?) and a crude line of path - a far cry from the upscale compounds of, say, East Hampton. Despite their slightness, these laconic sketches manage to capture a sense of harsh place. (Through tomorrow.)\n\nLawrence Calcagno (Foundations Gallery, 80 Warren Street): Lawrence Calcagno, well-known in the heyday of abstract expressionism for his very gestural landscape evocations, shows here a group of works from the 1960's that continue his abstract explorations of the landscape theme. But the surface of these beautifully orchestrated paintings is quieter, and they are structurally separated - horizontally - into two or three parts, a device that intensifies the impact of their color stratifications. Take, for instance, ''Silent Blue,'' a lyrical work from a series called ''Toward the Sea.'' The top ''sky'' panel is white with a black horizontal line that gives a concave look to the canvas. A middle panel, like a ''rest,'' is total black; the bottom panel begins with a light blue band, followed by a deep blue field. This field is inflected by a shaded black line that seems to make the canvas swell ever so slightly, a sea pulling against an inverted sky. These are intended as calm, ''contemplative'' works, but they are not devoid of sensuous pleasure. (Through June 5.)\n\nIllustrations: photo of Elie Nadelman drawing",

        "output": "IN a spirited tribute to the 100th anniversary of Elie Nadelman's birth, the Zabriskie Gallery, 29 West 57th Street, has mounted a show of nearly 100 works by the Polish-born artist (1882-1946), who is now considered to be one of this country's most accomplished sculptors.   In this, its fifth Nadelman presentation since 1967, the gallery concentrates on the artist's figures and drawings of women, a subject very close to his psyche. The figures here range from nearly lifesize bronzes to tiny, archaicized grotesqueries in clay, and there are 17 drawings recently found in Nadelman's Riverdale studio by his son, Jan, and never before exhibited. Also included are a group of posthumously published drypoint etchings, and six other drawings acquired not long ago from a Paris collection."

He picked up another 120 yards on 30 carries and scored three touchdowns in Canarsie's 30-6 semifinal triumph over August Martin at Canarsie Field.\n\n''I'm still going to do it but I may have to get an advance on my allowance because Russell Carter, the offensive tackle is 6-1, 240 and he can eat $30 worth of meat. I think I'm going to have to take them to the White Castle.''\n\nWin or lose, McLaughlin's dinner date with his blockers has been tentatively set for next Saturday following the P.S.A.L. B division championship game between undefeated (9-0) Canarsie and Midwood, the two time defending champion. Midwood (7-1-1) got into the final yesterday with a 16-6 triumph over Springfield Gardens in the other B division semifinal.\n\nAlthough Midwood is the only P.S.A.L. school ever to win a Metro Bowl game against the Catholic Schools champion when it defeated Xavier two years ago, the only loss the Hornets suffered this season was at the hands of Canarsie. However, that was only their first loss to the Chiefs in the last four meetings.\n\n''Last year we beat Canarsie 10-0 during the regular season and 15-12 in the semis,'' said Alan Arbuse, the coach at Midwood. ''Two years ago we beat them in the playoffs, too. I think it was the quarterfinals, but it may have been the semis. All of those games were at our place. This year they really did a number on us at their place, 22-0.''\n\n''No matter who we play, we have to play them at Midwood's AstroTurf field and both Midwood and Springfield Gardens have beaten us in some big games'' said the Canarsie coach, Frank Morogiello. He did not know who his opponent would be while he was talking since in the latest reports, Midwood and Springfield Gardens were locked in a 6-6 tie. Midwood scored 10 points in the final period to break the tie.\n\n''McLaughlin has been awesome on our little dirt field. He should be better when he gets some traction,'' Morogiello said. Allie Giannattasio rushed 20 times for 115 yards and scored the first touchdown in the game for Midwood on a 6-yard run, but the kick failed and Springfield Gardens tied the score on a 93-yard return of the ensuing kickoff by Cornell Morgan. The score stayed that way until Teddy Tucker scored on a 2-yard run in the final period. The conversion and a 35-yard field goal by the coach's son, Scott Arbuse, completed the scoring.\n\nMcLaughlin scored the first, second and final Canarsie touchdown, on runs of 2, 12 and 2 yards. Larry Triolo, the senior quarterback, ran in the extra points on the first two and McLaughlin ran in the extra point on the broken-play, a 6-yard pass from Triolo to Andrew Monjardo, the wingback, in the third period.\n\nIllustrations: photo of Ron McLaughlin and August Martin",

        "instruction": "Prof. Charles L. Black Jr., a leading authority on constitutional law who taught at Columbia and Yale Universities for 52 years and was a prominent voice in the national debates on presidential impeachments, desegregation, the death penalty and other issues, died at his home in Manhattan on Saturday. He was 85.\n\nThe cause was respiratory failure after a long illness, according to his wife, Barbara Aronstein Black.\n\nIn 1931, as a 16-year-old freshman studying Greek classics at the University of Texas at Austin, Charles Black, a jazz aficionado, heard Louis Armstrong play. He was dumbstruck by the genius of the performance, and by a conundrum: ''Blacks, the saying went, were 'all right in their place,' '' he recalled. ''But what was the place of such a man, and of the people from which he sprung?''\n\nIn 1954, as a teacher of constitutional law, Professor Black composed his answer, helping Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., and others, to write the legal brief for Linda Brown, a 10-year-old student in Topeka, Kan., whose historic case, Brown v. Board of Education, became the Supreme Court's definitive judgment on segregation in American education.\n\nIn a career that arched across the last half of the 20th century, Professor Black taught generations of law students, first at Columbia from 1947 to 1956, then at Yale for 30 years, and then at Columbia from 1986 until his health began to fail two years ago.\n\nAmong his students were Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (although not her fellow law student, Bill Clinton) and countless others who became leaders in government, business and academic life. (One of them was Professor Black's wife, the George Welwood Murray Professor of Law at Columbia and the school's first woman dean, serving from 1986 to 1991.)\n\nHe also wrote more than 20 books and hundreds of articles on constitutional law, admiralty law, capital punishment, the role of the judiciary and other legal subjects, including ''Impeachment: A Handbook,'' that was widely praised in 1974, when President Richard M. Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal, and also when reissued during the 1999 proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe handbook was an analysis of the law and history of impeachment, and took no position on the fates of Nixon or Clinton. As a liberal Democrat, Professor Black had no sympathy for Nixon politically. But in letters to newspapers, he argued against forcing Nixon to surrender tape recordings that implicated him, contending that the balance of federal power might be harmed if the principle of executive privilege was breached. But a judge ruled against Nixon, who resigned in the face of certain impeachment.\n\nProfessor Black was a vehement opponent of capital punishment, and his book, ''Capital Punishment: the Inevitability of Caprice and Mistake'' (Norton, 1974), argued against it. The United States Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1972, in part because states were arbitrarily imposing it. Dozens of states had passed new laws to revive the practice, and the book contended that the new statutes were as bad as the old ones.\n\nBesides his work in constitutional law, Professor Black developed a second major field in admiralty law, which governs maritime affairs. With a colleague, Grant Gilmore, he was the author of ''The Law of Admiralty'' (Foundation Press, 1957). There was a second edition in 1975. The book was widely regarded as the definitive text on the subject.\n\nColleagues were often struck by his legal insights, and a writing style that was eloquent and powerful. For example, while the Supreme Court often made news by striking down a lower court's ruling, he observed once that ''the prime and most necessary function of the Court has been that of validation, not that of invalidation,'' adding, ''What a government of limited powers needs, at the beginning and forever, is some means of satisfying the people that it has taken all steps humanly possible to stay within its powers.''\n\nProfessor Black -- who taught his students that being a good lawyer in an era of increasing specialization required that they broaden their horizons through interests outside the law -- was something of a renaissance man himself. He published three volumes of poetry; he painted landscapes in oil; and he played the trumpet and what he called a cowboy harmonica.\n\nHe lectured in a Texas drawl that drew on a rich blend of logic, metaphor, humor and poetry. Flowing along with the declarative sentences on torts and contracts were references to Descartes, to a Stuart king's last words as he was about to be beheaded, or to the rationality of Japanese gods.\n\n''It's mesmerizing,'' a former student wrote in a profile of the professor for an alumni magazine. ''It is not filibustering. It is all, beautifully, to the point.''\n\nAkhil Amar, a Yale law professor who was in many of Mr. Black's classes, said: ''He was my hero. So many of the great moral issues of the 20th century seem clear in retrospect, but were quite controversial at the time. He had the moral courage to go against his race, his class, his social circle.''",

The former Guess? girl and master face of Revlon stands up in buttery black leather pants that embrace her legs like the skin on the animal it once encased. Before igniting her signature pout for the camera, she arches her back, which juts out her famously insouciant C-cups.\n\nThe men in the room are like lifers contemplating the warden's key chain; castaways transfixed by a ship on the horizon. Their female dining companions are suddenly invisible to them, yet equally rapt. The room takes on the air of a jungle when all the chattering little monkeys in the food chain are suddenly reminded of their place by the Queen of Beasts.\n\n\"I always had that,\" Schiffer says, of the wanton attention she commands. Schiffer stopped time all over town last week while promoting \"Perfectly Fit,\" a series of four exercise videos abs, buns, arms and legs that she produced and stars in. Five-feet-11, 117 pounds, with poreless skin that looks as if it has been waxed of every hair and imperfection, Schiffer has a stylist on hand to fluff her long, satiny Barbie-doll hair. On her left hand glitters an engagement ring the size of a Tylenol gelcap. Given to her by illusionist David Copperfield, one of the world's richest entertainers, it is so blindingly bright that the interested onlooker cannot discern whether the cut is an oval or a marquis.\n\nEven before the Teutonic cover girl was discovered at age 17 in a Dusseldorf disco, she turned heads and elicited gasps. \"The difference from before was I was very shy when I was younger. When I came into a restaurant, I didn't like it when people were looking at me.\" Now she makes millions riveting the attentions she once reviled.\n\nSchiffer, who says she has never been in therapy, overcame her timidity with old-fashioned German force of will: \"I realized that to succeed in the business, I had to stop being shy.\"\n\nCelebrity exercise tapes took a drubbing last year. Some experts estimate the market sagged more than 30%. Schiffer smoothly assures that her tapes, filmed in St. Bart's and Prague, and co-starring trainer Kathy Kaehler pulsing, crunching, lifting and tilting, are viable: \"The trend is going to body-specific tapes. People want to work on their problem zones.\"\n\nHers feature a routine array of sculpting exercises, set to pop music with MTV-like transitions. She says she uses them herself. Even though \"I know the exercises by heart,\" she enjoys timing her movements to Kaehler's countdown. \"Many tapes on the market have had problems with safety,\" whereas hers are \"100% safe.\"\n\nShe refuses to take the bait when asked if she is referring to Cindy Crawford's first exercise video, which was flunked by Shape magazine for unsafe movements.\n\nA high school graduate, Schiffer is shrewdly intelligent in managing her persona, and fluently indirect on touchy and controversial topics, including rumors that 20th Century Fox paid her $1 million (of the $5 million she allegedly earns annually) for her video role. \"I usually don't talk about the money part: I leave it out,\" she chirps pleasantly. She does clarify that while she is a partner in Fashion Cafe, she was not an investor.\n\nSchiffer hit the hereditary Lotto in looks, but her sense of irony is underdeveloped. When asked if male devotees might be buying her videos to practice a different kind of exercise from those she is demonstrating in leotards and stretch tops, Schiffer doesn't grasp the question.\n\n\"They do the same number of reps, but they have a different goal sometimes,\" she intones seriously. \"I would suggest they use much heavier weights.\"\n\nShe is perplexed when it's suggested that her magician fiance might not have more success than any exercise video making the average woman look like a supermodel. Finally, she yields: \"Obviously, you're not going to transform into another person. But your body will transform into a more toned and shaped body.\"\n\nThe Monaco resident is an apostle of positive thinking, which is easy to understand when your life is a waking dream. After test photos were snapped eight years ago, her worst setback was getting lost on the Paris Metro. She has never been inconvenienced by stalkers, or been sexually harassed. Harassment \"sometime depends on the girl,\" she claims, explaining that she is extremely selective about the people with whom she works. She refuses to do \"even half-nudity. . . . When I do my calendars, I like the pictures to be sexy and provocative, but you can't see anything. . . . I wanted to succeed without taking my clothes off.\"\n\nShe won't be slipping into a wedding gown anytime soon, as Schiffer and Copperfield have still not set a date to end their two-year engagement.\n\nLess blessed models are now trying to unionize the profession, but Schiffer no more has an opinion on these efforts than she does on O.J.'s acquittal. She becomes an outspoken supply-sider, however, when asked about designers trying to cap the salaries of the runway supernovas: \"If a designer didn't want to spend so much money, he shouldn't complain about using girls who are unknown.\"\n\nShe declares that she has never had plastic surgery. That, she opines is \"good for people who have accidents.\"\n\n\"I'm talking about accidents like you have a car accident.\"",

She was previously wed twice to the author and playwright William Saroyan.\n\nWith the publication of ''Among the Porcupines: A Memoir'' (Random/Turtle Bay) in 1992, the mercurial wit that was both loved and feared by friends like Maureen Stapleton, Oona O'Neill, Gloria Vanderbilt and Truman Capote became public property.\n\nFor example, when a Swedish starlet flirted with Mr. Matthau and he asked her age, Mrs. Matthau said she interjected, ''For God's sake, Walter, why don't you chop off her legs and read the rings?''\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times shortly after the book's publication, she said: ''I married Saroyan the second time because I couldn't believe how terrible it was the first time. I married Walter because I love to sleep with him.''\n\nShe was a friend of Capote for decades and laid claim in her memoir to having been his muse for Holly Golightly, the blithe spirit of his ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' She also figured in the ''Côte Basque'' section of his ''Answered Prayers'' and defended Capote long after other unwitting celebrity subjects turned against him.\n\nRejecting the Holly Golightly part later in life, however, she said there were only two roles she coveted: Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' and Amanda Wingfield, or, as she put it: ''The lady who sells magazine subscriptions on the telephone. You know, 'The Glass Menagerie.'

The union with Saroyan, who was well known for his difficulty, was far from happy. After the second divorce, they parted company for good. By then she had met Walter Matthau and studied Method acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.\n\nShe understudied Jayne Mansfield in ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' and married Matthau in August 1959.

Sonya hopes for one too, for that and the life of a happy family. A ha ppy family is not simply a mother, fathe r and some children contained by their own four walls. Above all, it is a stay against chaos.\n\nBut chaos is what Sonya is to know. Poor, lonely, chain-smoking Valery dies after the birth of her second daughter, Greta, done in by cancer and by Christian Science. Ray is left to raise his children in the only way he knows: by conning. As he tries to con others into lending him money for mining, so he tries to con Sonya, Greta and himself into believing themselves the ''Three Little Weilers,'' a trio as comfortable and cozy as the Three Little Kittens or Papa, Mama and Baby Bear. Greta is too young to know anything, Ray too self-deluded to face anything, only Sonya is fully aware of the terrible disorder of their lives.\n\nThey move, and move again. Housekeepers, some of them Ray's bedmates and almost all of them deficient in something, usually kindness, come and go. The ''dream house'' never materializes, except temporarily. Somehow, Ray manages a private school education for Sonya and Sonya manages a childhood for Greta.\n\nSonya works her way through college, makes a home for Greta, eventually marries, has children and makes a home for herself. Ray drifts in and out of her life, not quite a bad penny, still dreaming his schemes, dreaming his time. Present or absent, he colors all her days. When he dies, she cannot bury him, literally or figuratively: his body isn't found for years. Pathetic, paranoid, dishonest, deluded, Ray haunts Sonya; he also haunts the book.\n\n''Imginary Crimes'' has two voices, Sonya's and a storyteller's, in fluent alternation. The tale they tell is sad but neither voice ever succumbs to pathos, although they skirt it, perhaps because they are steeled with humor.\n\n''It was wonderful to be in love with someone who was not only a thinker, but who appreciated foreign films,'' the clear-eyed Sonya says about one of her professors. ''It didn't even matter when he said he was married; this kind of man came along once in a lifetime in 1957.'' And although the specifics of Sonya's life are unusual, what she wants is touchingly usual - a home, love, warmth, safety. Which means that when one is reading about Sonya one is also reading about oneself, or at least that part of onese lf that wants to come infrom the cold. That Sonya is a clearly define d child of the 50's is no impediment to identification either. It ma y, in fact, be a help. The 50's, being one of our plainer decades, m ay have produced a plainer, more accessible kind of person.\n\nIt would be a pity if ''Imaginary Crimes'' - written by a woman about a woman and bearing the imprimatur of two well-known female writers on its jacket - were herded into that literary ghetto called ''female fiction.'' Instead it belongs in that part of the imaginary library which is both broader in scope and extremely difficult to enter - the one titled ''fine fiction.''\n\nBut for the last few pages, in which the author feels impelled to tie up what she seems to see as loose strings and to shout what before she has so beautifully whispered, ''Imaginary Crimes'' is just about flawless. Sonya finally triumphs over her life, but it is Ray who walks away with the book. ''And now I must be on my way again,'' the con man writes. ''I will be loving you, dear Sonya, every moment I have life; in the lovely midnight hours and in the iridescent splendor of the dawn; in the brilliant light of noon-time and when the evening shadows steal across the valley, and the sun is setting in the purple hills.'' Miss Ballantyne should be very proud of herself.\n\nIllustrations: Photo of Sheila Ballantyne",

        "instruction": "NORWICH, Conn.— At a picturesque point along the Yantic River, an 1813 red-brick, 90,000-square-foot mill building, once a nail factory and later a textile plant, is nearing the end of its conversion into 121 apartments.\n\nSimilar conversions are taking place in Victorian mills throughout the Northeast, particularly in New England. Between 50 and 100 mills have been converted to market-rate or subsidized housing in the last few years, according to Robert M. Vogel, vice president of the Society for Industrial Archeology with headquarters in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington.\n\nEven more new housing from old mills is expected in the future, say developers and others in the field, who point to several factors favoring these conversions.\n\nThose factors are: a supply of approximately 1,000 suitable mills in the region; a stronger demand for small-unit, community-style housing; and the ease with which the mills with their large, open interior spaces can be converted. Another favorable element is that these buildings are frequently eligible for tax incentives as historic structures.\n\nLocal communities, in addition, usually welcome mill conversions. These projects are helping to revitalize dilapidated commercial areas of aging industrial communities as well as offering a radical alternative to single-family housing or garden apartments in more traditional settings.\n\nSome of these sites are also being used for groups that have had special housing needs. In Paterson, N.J., the 110-year-old Essex Mill and the 1812 Phoenix Mill are being converted into 146 federally subsidized loft apartments for working artists. The Florence Mill in Vernon, Conn., has been converted into 114 units for the elderly.\n\nThough most of the conversions so far have been for housing, some mills have been recycled to office and retail uses. The 1835 Rogers Mill in Paterson, where steam locomotives used to be manufactured, is being rented at $8.50 a square foot. The first tenants in the 30,000-square-foot building are an advertising agency, an insurance firm and an engineering group. Developers of an early Victorian water-powered mill that produced fire hoses in Newtown, Conn., are looking for a tenant to use the 90,000 square feet for a corporate headquarters.\n\nOffice conversions usually present fewer zoning problems. For instance, Peter Jennings, of Munro & Jennings of Hartford, developers of the Newtown mill, said the only zoning modification necessary would be if they rented to several tenants instead of one. The building is zoned for a sole occupant.\n\nMost of the mills that have potential for conversion are in the New England states or New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. This was the area where hilly land coupled with plenty of small, fast-running streams made the terrain ideal for water-powered manufacturing. These small mills, estimated by Mr. Vogel to be in the thousands, fell into disuse over the years as more modern manufacturing techniques were better suited to a one-story building located nearer a highway. Many of these manufacturers also moved south, seeking cheaper labor. Subsequently a great many of the mill buildings languished for years as warehouses before recycling gained momentum about 15 years ago.\n\n''There are tough times ahead and people are looking in their own back-yards to see if there is a building that is obsolete or underutilized,'' explained Stephen B. Jacobs, a New York City architect who has designed many Manhattan conversion projects. Mr. Jacobs is working on both the Paterson and the Norwich mills.\n\nRalph Schacter and Seymour Schwartz, partners in Greenwich Associates, the firm that is developing a 29-acre former felt factory complex in Greenwich, Conn., believe former mill sites are ideal for recreating the close-knit village life that was envisioned when industrialists built the mills and the shops and offices surrounding them more than a century ago. ''There are changes taking place in suburban life that we must begin to address with a new sort of housing,'' said Mr. Schacter.\n\nIn addition to 69 rental apartments and 58 town-house condominiums on the surrounding vacant land, the Greenwich complex will also include 91,000 square feet of commercial space plus a cluster of specialty shops in an abandoned Victorian railroad station already on the site. To be called simply The Mill in Greenwich, the property was purchased from G.A.F. Corporation in December of 1978 for $5.3 million. The development is scheduled to be completed in 1982 at a cost expected to exceed $20 million, all of which has been provided by conventional financing.\n\nRents will run from $650 a month for a studio apartment of approximately 700 square feet, to $1,400 for a two-bedroom apartment of approximately 1,200 square feet.\n\nA majority of the mills targeted for housing are eligible for incentives provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1976. The law allows a conversion project involving any building listed on the National Register of Historic Places or situated in a locally designated historic district - as many of the mills happen to be - to qualify for an accelerated five-year depreciation of costs. Normally such costs would have to be depreciated over a 14- to 20-year period. The tax concession is limited to rented properties, so most of these mill conversions are initially being turned into rentals rather than condominiums.",

        "instruction": "Anshe Chung, a real-estate tycoon in the digitally simulated world known as Second Life, has apparently become the first virtual millionaire–i.e., someone whose holdings in a make-believe world are legally convertible into genuine U.S. currency worth more than $1 million.\n\nChung is the nom de keyboard of Ailin Graef, a former schoolteacher who says she was born and raised in Hubei, China, and is now a citizen of Germany. She will give a press conference about her achievement tomorrow (November 28) at 9:00 a.m. PST, although it will occur in-world, i.e., to attend you will need to have downloaded Second Life’s software from the company that created and maintains it, Linden Lab. Here is Chung’s announcement, which has additional details. (A spokesperson for Linden Lab told me she could not immediately verify Chung’s claim, because Chung’s property is held in many different names, but hopes to have the information by later today.)\n\nI wrote about Chung a little bit in a Fortune feature story in November 2005, called “From Megs to Riches,” which focused on the broader phenomenon of people earning real money from activities they engage in while playing online games. That story is available here. (In all candor, at this point, every major news organization has written at least one such story, and a fair number of those were published before mine.)\n\nSecond Life’s creators and denizens do not like it to be called a game–you don’t shoot at monsters while you’re there, for instance–but it might be categorized nonetheless as a special variety of so-called massively multiplayer online role-playing game (or MMORPG for relatively short), albeit one that is more akin to SimCity than to World of Warcraft. In Second Life, subscribers get a tool kit that enables them to build and create an avatar (a character in the world). They also get a small quantity of Linden dollars to start out with, enabling the participant to buy additional tools and objects within the world itself. Linden Lab converts currency at a floating rate that, at the moment, is about 257 Linden dollars per U.S. dollar.\n\nThough you can buy additional Linden dollars from Linden Lab by paying U.S. currency, Chung says she has made all her additional Linden dollars via in-world buying, building, trading, and selling. The lion’s share of it, she says, has been made by buying, developing, and then renting or reselling “land”–i.e., control over the virtual real estate simulated by Linden’s servers. Each of Linden Lab’s servers simulates about 16 acres of in-world property. At the time I wrote my article in November 2005, Chung was developing private islands and setting up communities restricted to, for instance, East Asian, Victorian, or Gothic architecture, or to French-speakers, or to gays and lesbians, or to fuzzy avatars known as “furries.” Because Linden Lab has added simulation servers more slowly than it has accumulated subscribers, virtual property values have soared.\n\nWhy, you may wonder, do I consider Chung’s achievement to be a suitable topic for a legal affairs blog? Well, it’s a bit of a stretch. But, as I explained in my earlier feature story, the whole topic of buying and selling “virtual” property does raise legal issues. Some online game companies have attempted to prohibit, through click-through agreements, the real-world buying and selling of online property created by players, which the companies maintain remains the company’s intellectual property–indeed, just graphical manifestations of data entered into company-owned spreadsheets on company-owned servers. Second Life, on the other hand, openly authorizes and facilitates exchanges between its currency and real-world currencies, so that particular legal issue does not arise. Still, you might ask whether Linden Lab is courting legal liability if its servers should suddenly go down one day, destroyed, say, in some real-world earthquake, leaving Second Life denizens devoid of “property” or at least expectations in which they’ve invested so much real time and money. What do people think?",

        "instruction": "While lunching with an extremely vital man some years ago, I was dismayed during the fish course to notice that he had a wog on his chin. For people who have never been in this predicament, I should explain that a wog is a tiny piece of food that has somehow escaped the eater's mouth and lodged itself on his face.\n\nThe chin and the cheeks are where wogs usually settle. The difficulty with them is that the person with a wog on his face can't see it, but everybody else can. As a result any train of thought that has been running across the table gets derailed as soon as the wog appears.\n\nThis is what happened during that lunch. The extremely vital man was talking profound talk - ''We live in an age when implications are profound,'' or something like that - and I was trying to look grave and deep when I noticed the wog on his chin. My mind instantly abandoned profound implications and cried, ''Good Lord! He has a wog on his chin.''\n\nOblivious to the wog, he went on talking deep. It became harder and harder to look him in the eye. My glance kept dropping to his chin. It became terribly important to know what kind of wog it was. If it was a bread wog it might drop away, ending the crisis without a fuss. Bread wogs often do that. So do cake wogs.\n\nThis, however, was a fish wog, one of the worst kind. Like egg wogs and oily lettuce-leaf wogs, a fish wog seems to get glued on and nothing removes it but a swipe of the napkin. Now, my question to the well-mannered public is: What do you do in this situation?\n\nDo you reach across the table and swipe his chin with a napkin? If so, you have to be prepared to say, ''Sorry about that, but sometimes my reflexes go haywire.'' In which case, he puts you down as an eccentric and never has you to lunch again.\n\nOn the other hand you can hardly butt in while he is warning you about the profundity of the implications and say, ''Pardon me, but you've got a fish wog on your chin.'' Or so it seemed to me that day. ''Why do you keep staring at my chin?'' he asked.\n\nQuick as a whip, I said, ''I have never seen a chin with such profound implications.'' He was flattered by that, and the meal dragged on. Leaving the restaurant, he paused at the washroom and came out white with humiliation. ''How could you let me sit through an entire meal with a fish wog on my chin?'' he whimpered.\n\nThe answer is that he was so vital that he awed me. There are some people you can interrupt with ''Brush the wog off your chin'' without being at all self-conscious, but these are only the dearest of relatives. When social disparity is greater, a wog presents one of society's gravest problems.\n\nSuppose, for example, that you and a couple of friends -say, Kermit and Katz - are invited to eat with the President, and the President is talking on about the threat to civilization, and suddenly all three of you notice a wog on his cheek.\n\nYou and Kermit and Katz are not going to get much out of the President's conversation from that moment on, are you? All three of you are going to be too busy thinking, ''My God, the President's got a wog on his cheek? Why doesn't somebody do something about it?''\n\nOf course, now that I have had long experience with the wog problem, I know you have to deal with each one according to your reading of the victim's personality. With President Reagan it would probably be easy to say, ''Speaking of the threat to civilization, Mr. President, you've got a little wog there on your left cheek.''\n\nRonald Reagan gives you the feeling he would just chuckle and tell you an anecdote about a time when all the Warner brothers attended an Academy Awards show with blintz wogs on their chins.\n\nIt is more serious if the President is someone like Richard Nixon or Lyndon Johnson. Presidents of their disposition, so uneasy about their personal appearances, might become so irritated they would order the Pentagon to give the wog a whiff of the grape.\n\nIn such cases I've had good results from relying on the science of sympathetic body language or, in plainer terms, the monkey-see, monkey-do principle. If the wog victim is someone easily irritated - like Secretary of State Haig, for example - I do not call verbal attention to the wog. Instead, after noting its location, I look the victim hard in the eye without blinking, then with great deliberation bring my hand to my chin or cheek, matching it to the wog's location on the victim's face, and rub it back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\n\nThe great man, wishing to woo you with body language as well as his verbal charms, will in nine cases out of 10 raise his own hand subconsciously to the identical spot on his dynamic face and rub the wog away. In most cases he will not even notice it.\n\nIf he does, the trick is to begin rubbing other parts -your ear lobes, throat, forehead - parts which on the victim are wog free. Gingerly, he will test his ear lobes, throat and forehead for more wogs and, finding none, assume that you were not signaling him about his embarrassing wog, but merely suffer from a disgusting compulsion to rub yourself at the table. This will probably improve his day by making him feel superior.",

He declined to specify why the deal had collapsed, but said that ''it was strictly a business disagreement.''\n\nNeil Papiano, the Los Angeles lawyer who was Nederlander's partner in the purchase, said in a telephone interview that ''we didn't call it off, I think they just took the team off the market.\n\n''There have been minor disagreements during the negotiations,'' Papiano added, ''but nothing major enough to cause the deal to fall through. Maybe it was an accumulation of differences. Or maybe it was seller's remorse, like when you're selling a car. Gabe telephoned me and said they had decided not to go ahead, and I told him that no one can force you to sell anything you own.'' An Offer of $10 Million\n\nNederlander and Papiano had offered to pay $10 million for a controlling interest in the club, just under 60 percent. The present owner, Steve O'Neill of Cleveland, once a partner with Paul in the New York Yankees, intended to keep 10 percent. The rest of the stock was earmarked for a group of minor shareholders, mostly from Cleveland or elsewhere in Ohio. The two sides had set a target date of Jan. 29 for a final agreement.\n\n''Sometimes,'' Paul said in a telephone interview, ''things seem close but then collapse, like deals for players. There were some issues we couldn't work out. I can't be more specific than that. But they are two fine gentlemen and we have the highest regard for them.\n\n''What do we do now? We carry on. Steve O'Neill is still the principal owner, and he is perfectly able to carry on. The club is far from desperate. There was no auction, nothing like that. And even if the club had been sold, I would have remained as president and chief executive officer.''\n\n''I understand,'' O'Neill said, referring to Paul and the other negotiators, ''that they just reached an impasse.'' Indians Finished Sixth\n\nThe Indians finished in sixth place, next to last, in the American League's Eastern Division last season. They drew just over 1 million fans, and reportedly lost $2 million.\n\nPapiano denied that local ownership was a problem, as it was recently in the case of the Chicago White Sox, whose sale to Edward DeBartolo Sr. was vetoed twice by the American League. He also said that price was no problem.\n\n''We intended to abide by the agreement in principle,'' he said. ''We thought we were going on to make a deal. I'm very disappointed. Gabe told me there's no other buyer. I'd like to think it's possible to reopen the discussion, but I don't know. I suppose they just felt it best not to sell.''\n\nThe sale seemed so sure in recent weeks that the NederlanderPapiano group even joined the Indians in trying to sign Dave Winfield as a free agent before the outfielder accepted a 10-year contract from the Yankees.\n\n''They didn't advance any money,'' Paul related. ''Jim has movie connections, and they were offering to put Winfield in the movies and get some endorsements for him, and thereby reduce the load on the ball club. But no money was involved for the club, not a dime.''",

        "instruction": "The Metropolitan Transportation Authority signed a contract with a Japanese company yesterday for the purchase of 325 subway cars and announced that the deal would be financed in part by a $126 million loan from the Government of Japan.\n\nThe passenger cars, which are scheduled to begin arriving in December 1983 and should all be in service by 1985, will be the first purchased for the New York City subway system from a foreign manufacturer. They will replace IRT cars that are 25 to 35 years old.\n\nThe negotiated price of each new car was $844,500, for a total purchase price of $274,462,500. The price is subject to the cost of metals at the time of construction.\n\nRichard Ravitch, the chairman of the M.T.A., said that Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. was chosen to build the cars, which are described as graffiti-resistant, for several reasons, including price, quality, date of delivery and financing.\n\n''We were heartened by the willingness of a foreign manufacturer and a foreign government to extend us credit,'' Mr. Ravitch said at a news conference at which he was surrounded by officials of Kawasaki and Nissho-Iwai American Corporation, the trading company that negotiated the deal.\n\nOther American cities, such as Philadelphia and Atlanta, have purchased subway cars from foreign manufacturers, but the M.T.A. deal represented the first time that a foreign government has helped finance such a purchase.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank of Japan, a Government institution, will lend the money in yen to Nissho-Iwai, which will in turn extend credit to the M.T.A. in dollars. Over the next eight years, the M.T.A. will repay the loan in dollars, which will be converted to yen by Nissho-Iwai before repaying the Japanese bank.\n\nUnder the contract, the M.T.A. must pay a fee of $40,400 a car to Nissho-Iwai for assuming the risk of fluctuations in the yen. According to Steven Polan, special counsel to the M.T.A., the extra payment will result in an effective interest rate of 12.25 percent, better than the authority could get by borrowing in the bond markets in this country. The M.T.A. has never borrowed in the municipal bond market and, therefore, it was difficult to determine yesterday what interest rate it would have had to pay if it had taken that course.\n\nLoans from foreign governments have in the past helped private American companies finance such large purchases as airplanes and ships, but have never been used in public transit, according to Mr. Polan. The new agreement was certain to intensify the controversy over the purchase of foreign goods at a time of large-scale unemployment in the United States. Ravitch Anticipates Criticism\n\nYesterday, before the Kawasaki deal was announced, James L. Emery, the Geneseo Republican who is the minority leader of the State Assembly, released a letter to Mr. Ravitch insisting that all cars purchased by the M.T.A. be manufactured in the United States, ''and most preferably in New York State.''\n\nIn his announcement yesterday, Mr. Ravitch apparently anticipated such criticism. Instead of a press release, a three-page, singlespace explanation of why the M.T.A. had decided on a foreign manufacturer was distributed at the news conference, which was held at the authority's headquaters at 347 Madison Avenue.\n\nMr. Ravitch said that only one American corporation, the Budd Company of Troy, Mich., had competed for the subway-car contract. ''We believe that the deal with Kawasaki represents to the public of New York the best opportunity,'' Mr. Ravitch said.\n\nThe M.T.A. chairman also said that 43 percent of the equipment in the new cars - including the couplers, brakes and traction motors - will be built in this country. Where possible, he added, New York companies will be used as subcontractors. No Federal Funds Involved\n\nThe American parts will be shipped to Japan, where Kawasaki will assemble the vehicles. They will then be sent back to the United States and subject to a 5 percent import tax. ''The import tax will help your Federal Government,'' said Shunro Mori, president of Nissho-Iwai.\n\nIn addition to the Japanese financing, the cars will be paid for by state and local contributions, money raised by the M.T.A. through the sale of bonds and through the sale of subway cars to private companies for tax advantages.\n\nSince there is no Federal money involved in the deal, the ''Buy America'' provisions of Federal law - which require the use of American suppliers -do not apply.\n\nThe new cars, Mr. Ravitch said, will look very much like the cars now in service on the IRT. ''We did not want to have a lot of gadgets, widgets and blandishments,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''They will be built for reliability, service and comfort.''\n\nThe cars will, however, be different in two respects: They will be air-conditioned and will have stainless-steel exteriors that resist graffiti.",

The Democratic pledge, sought by supporters of Mayor Koch's campaign for Governor, would be aimed at Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who wants the Democratic line and is scheduled to be promised the Liberal one today by that party's leaders.\n\n''Basically a huff-and-puff gesture,'' Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager, William Haddad, said yesterday. ''I don't think it will happen.'' Says It Hasn't Happened Before\n\nRequiring such a pledge, he said, ''would be clearly designed to turn the convention into a Koch platform.'' ''It wasn't done to previous candidates, like Governor Carey,'' Mr. Haddad added. The Republican pledge, designed by those party leaders who support Paul J. Curran or James L. Emery for Governor, is aimed at Lewis E. Lehrman, the wealthy businessman who has been promised the Conservative line and wants the Republican one.\n\nMr. Lehrman, in a letter delivered yesterday to George L. Clark Jr., the party's state chairman, said: ''I intend to support the winner of the Republican primary for Governor. I fully expect to be that candidate.'' Others Want Conservative Line\n\nHe noted that his three opponents -Mr. Curran, former United States Attorney for the Southern District; Mr. Emery, the Assembly minority leader, and Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former state G.O.P. chairman - all were seeking the Conservative line, too.\n\nIn a separate statement, Mr. Emery urged that candidates promise not to gather petitions to get on the ballot if they are not put on by the party meeting.\n\nNeither the Democratic nor the Republican leaders have worked out the wording of the proposed loyalty oaths, but neither party planned to include sanctions for failure to comply.",

        "instruction": "Mayor Koch and his observations on race relations provoked controversy again, this time over the weekend in Baltimore, where Democratic Party leaders gathered to search their souls as part of a newly formed National Strategy Council.\n\nSchool busing and quotas have not worked and perhaps have even aggravated racial tensions, the Mayor said. As it has before, that comment touched off a heated exchange between the Mayor and his old friend and nemesis, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan.\n\nOf all the disputes that have arisen during Mr. Koch's four years at City Hall, none has been as enduring as the matter of his sensitivity or insensitivity to racial minorities. But overshadowed in Baltimore was the fact that the Mayor had come forth with a thorough assault on virtually every major Democratic initiative of the last two decades.\n\nRace was only one issue of many on his mind, taking up two sentences in a seven-page statement. Some Other Targets\n\nMedicaid and food-stamp programs have been vitiated by abuse, Mr. Koch said. When job-training programs failed, they received more money, he contended. Democratic anticrime policies too often abetted criminals rather than assisted victims.\n\nEnvironmental mandates, he said, were too expensive or beyond the capability of existing technologies. And poverty programs benefited the people who ran them, not the poor.\n\nThere was little in the statement that Mr. Koch had not said at one time or another, even before he invited skepticism about his party loyalty by seeking the Republican as well as the Democratic nomination for Mayor this year.\n\nUsually, though, his feelings are expressed in slogans that make him appear at times to be more interested in quips than thoughts - as when he refers to himself as ''Mayor Culpa'' for having voted as a Congressman for many of the programs he now deplores. Measure and Meter\n\nIn Baltimore, with a national audience ready to listen, his views were sculptured with measure and even meter, apparently reflecting the efforts of his Deputy Mayor for Policy, Robert F. Wagner Jr., who drafted the Koch statement.\n\n''What happened over the last decade,'' Mr. Wagner wrote for the Mayor, ''is that we became the party of the status quo, the party of government for government's sake, the party of abstraction.''\n\n''Rather than seeing ourselves as the inheritors of a dynamic, pragmatic, humane tradition,'' the statement continued, ''we sought to embalm our past successes - the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier, the Great Society - in regulations and programs. We lost touch with reality.''\n\nWhat the Democrats needed, in Mr. Koch's view, was to seek ''the center.'' In brief, the Mayor said, the party had to become more like him - or at least as he perceives himself, a ''centrist.''\n\nOne obvious question was whether Mr. Koch, a self-avowed pragmatist of often-shifting opinions, in fact sits at the center of Democratic politics. In New York, many would put him in the right wing. Others believe that on a national level he is too quick to identify certain circumstances as being created by Democrats when they are nonpartisan in nature.\n\n''The world is not Manhattan,'' Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, asserted in Baltimore. For example, he said, many Americans, worried about crime, may be angry at the courts, and in New York most judges are Democrats. But elsewhere, including the United States Supreme Court, Mr. Frank said, they frequently are appointed by Republicans. Ideological Lines Drawn\n\nIncreasingly, Mr. Koch articulates the thinking of people who once referred to themselves as liberals but now go by the well-worn sobriquet of neoconservative. More clearly than many others at the weekend conference, he seemed willing to draw ideological lines against other elements of the Democratic Party, such as that led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy.\n\nThe Mayor thus underscored the potential for divisive internal debate before the party settles on a direction for the 1984 Presidential election.\n\nAt one point on Saturday, resorting to a vulgarity for emphasis, Mr. Koch questioned the ability of the Government to do anything. ''People say every time the Federal Government does it, it comes out backwards,'' he said.\n\nAnd yet, unlike a true conservative, who has little faith in government, the Mayor called for even more Washington involvement in certain issues.\n\nThe Federal Government, he said, should assume welfare and Medicaid costs. It must provide housing subsidies, he added, and has an obligation to continue mass-transit subsidies.\n\nThere was an element of self-serving logic to that, Deputy Mayor Wagner acknowledged yesterday. Government was bad, Mr. Koch was saying, except perhaps for that part of government which - perhaps not coincidentally -makes it easier for him and other mayors to balance their budgets.\n\nIn that, Mr. Koch demonstrated what has become growingly evident over the last few years - that no matter where his roots may lie, his heart is free of party. He is a pragmatist first and a Democrat second, and in his view what counts is that which makes governing easier, no matter which party provides it.",

        "instruction": "Financial executives, according to a new survey, are growing more bullish about the prospects for reducing inflation. A March poll showed rising estimates of the probability that the Federal budget will be balanced within five years and that long-term bonds will yield real pretax returns over the next decade. The poll, by Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., averaged the views of 346 chief investment officers, stock and bond portfolio managers, corporate financial officers, economists and stock analysts since polls in September and December.\n\nBond buyers, however, are especially skeptical. One key confidence indicator - the yield on long-term bonds - is not reflecting the trend Bache found. Bond prices fell last week even after the Senate easily handed the Reagan Administration the budget cuts it sought. Bond buyers are unlikely to be impressed unless the budget also fares well in the Democratic-controlled House.\n\nRichard B. Hoey, the Bache analyst who conducted the poll, said that the Administration was proving that it could raise confidence but had yet to show how it could translate that into helping the economy, Arms and the Northeast\n\nThe Reagan Administration's proposals for expanding defense expenditures would produce substantial spending increases in the Northeast in fiscal 1982, according to a forecast by Regional Data Associates. New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts would be among the top seven recipients of the additional expenditures, assuming that spending follows the pattern of 1980 contract awards and that the distribution of military personnel has not changed significantly since 1979. Roughly 60 percent of the increase will be felt through contract awards. The remaining 40 percent, planned for military wage and benefit increases, maintenance and operating expenses, will have an indirect local impact. In terms of allocations per capita, which experts consider to be a better indicator of regional impact than gross expenditures, the study shows New York ranking 28th, but Connecticut (3d), Massachusetts (9th) and Maine (12th) faring well. Japan and Genetics\n\nThere is growing curiosity about where Japan will place its initial economic bets in the burgeoning biotechnology field. Last October, Japan's aggressive Ministry of International Trade and Industry pushed five major chemical companies into a biotechnology council to encourage information exchange. The ministry is said to be planning to spend $165 million by 1990 on biotechnology research.\n\nNevertheless, the five chemical companies in the forum - Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Asahi, Mitsui Poatsu, and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo - have pursued diverse paths and will probably continue to do so, despite the ministry's efforts, according to a Japanese stock analyst here.\n\nJapanese companies are not known for advanced biotechnology research. But they are highly respected for their applications, especially in industrial fermentation. Some experts predict that several link-ups between Japanese companies and research-oriented American companies will soon be announced. Easing the Ex-Im Blow\n\nThe Reagan Administration remains committed to cutting the lending authority of the Export-Import Bank, but some exporters of nuclear power plants who will be hurt say they detect a ''moderation of attitude.''\n\nExporters of nuclear power plants are among those pushing hardest to encourage second thoughts about such cuts. While domestic nuclear orders have dried up, foreign sales supported by Ex-Im Bank financing continued. Without such support, companies like Westinghouse and General Electric may well be shut out of the crucial overseas market by subsidized competition from France.\n\nSenator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, has proposed legislation for a $1 billion fund that could be used to counter proposals by foreign companies that are subsidized by their governments. Washington observers are currently pessimistic about that plan's chances.\n\nHowever, they say the Administration may support tax relief designed to soften the impact of lowered Ex-Im lending authority. Revision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which restricts payments to overseas officials, might also be given higher priority. Barnaby J. Feder",
